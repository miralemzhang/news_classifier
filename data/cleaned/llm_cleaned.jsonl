The ministers discussed ongoing preparations for the session , which both sides see as a key step in consolidating the recent improvement in bilateral relations. The second meeting is expected to mark a milestone in the normalization of ties following years of strained relations and a gradual rapprochement. Egyptian and Turkish officials have increasingly framed the process as a transition toward a full strategic partnership . The call followed the first meeting of the Egypt–Türkiye Joint Planning Group , held in Ankara in November, which Abdelatty said translated directives from El-Sisi and Erdogan into concrete steps to elevate relations. Discussions have focused on expanding cooperation in trade, energy, investment, transport, education, tourism , and information technology, as well as strengthening coordination on regional security issues. Momentum in bilateral ties was reinforced by reciprocal presidential visits in 2024, including Erdogan’s trip to Cairo in February and El-Sisi’s visit to Ankara in September, which resulted in the signing of 15 bilateral agreements. Abdelatty and Fidan also exchanged views on regional developments , including the situation in the Gaza Strip. Abdelatty stressed the need to implement commitments under the second phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan, support the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and deploy an International Stabilization Force (ISF) to monitor the ceasefire. He underscored the importance of laying the groundwork for early recovery and reconstruction, as well as ensuring the continued and unhindered entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The talks also covered developments in Sudan. Abdelatty emphasized the need to push toward a humanitarian truce as a step toward a comprehensive ceasefire, while reaffirming Egypt’s position on preserving Sudan’s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, supporting its national institutions, and ensuring safe havens and unimpeded humanitarian access for civilians.",

Israel has continued to launch regular strikes in the area even after a ceasefire was agreed with Hezbollah in November 2024 to end more than a year of hostilities. \"A short while ago, the (Israeli military) struck terror infrastructure in several areas of southern Lebanon... used by Hezbollah to conduct drills and training for terrorists\" to attack Israeli forces and civilians, the military said in a statement. Last week, the Lebanese army said it had completed disarming Hezbollah south of the Litani River in the first phase of a nationwide plan.

Displaced Yemenis receive humanitarian aid provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) in the city of Taiz. AFP Related Yemeni heritage under attack Southern mutiny in Yemen contained? A timeline of the Yemen conflict Julien Harneis, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen , said he feared the calamitous situation would go under the radar until the death toll mounts . The picture in Yemen is \"very, very concerning\", he told reporters in Geneva. Last year, 19.5 million people in the country needed humanitarian aid -- and the UN's response plan for the country was only 28-percent financed, at $688 million. \"We are expecting things to be much worse in 2026 ,\" said Harneis, pointing out that 21 million Yemenis were in need and aid was drying up. He said food insecurity was increasing, particularly on the Red Sea coast, while the health system, supported by the United Nations and the World Bank for the last 10 years, was \"not going to be supported in the way it has been in the past\". He said Yemenis would be \"very vulnerable to epidemics\" this year, warning: \"A humanitarian crisis in Yemen is a risk to the Arabian Peninsula. Cholera, measles and polio cross borders.\" \"My fear is that we won't hear about it until the mortality and the morbidity significantly increases this next year,\" he added. Harneis said the aid focus this year would be on malnutrition, public health and food insecurity. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has heavily slashed foreign aid and other key donor countries have been tightening their belts. Harneis said the UN was trying to work with NGOs to see if they could plug any of the gaps. \"Children are dying -- and it's going to get worse,\" he said. \"For 10 years, the UN and humanitarian organisations were able to improve mortality and morbidity,\" he pointed out. \"With the conjunction we're seeing this year, that's not going to be the case. That is the simple story that everybody needs to understand.\"",

  "text": "Ahram Online , Monday 19 Jan 2026 Egypt has welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire and integration agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), saying it hopes the deal will lead to a comprehensive political process that includes all Syrian parties. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Related Syrian army deploys in Deir Ezzor province after Kurdish withdrawal Syrian president announces deal with Kurds including truce Syrian army extends hold over north Syria, Kurds report clashes In a statement issued on Monday, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the agreement could help preserve Syria’s unity, support its security and stability, and protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Cairo reaffirmed its long-standing position that Syria’s unity and territorial integrity must be upheld, and that national state institutions should be supported so they can carry out their responsibilities in maintaining stability and protecting the rights and resources of the Syrian people. Egypt also stressed the importance of ensuring lasting security and stability for all segments of Syrian society, safeguarding citizens’ rights, and strengthening national unity. The statement highlighted the need to continue efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and to address the issue of foreign terrorist fighters, describing both as essential to restoring security and stability in Syria and the wider region. Egypt said it would continue to support regional and international efforts aimed at reaching a comprehensive and lasting political solution to the Syrian crisis. The agreement between the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led SDF ends nearly two weeks of fighting and is part of a broader deal that will integrate the SDF into Syria’s military and state institutions. Announced on Sunday, the agreement allows the Syrian army to take control of three eastern and northern governorates, Al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor, and Raqqa, previously held by the SDF.",

Inter Milan's Turkish midfielder #20 Hakan Calhanoglu (R) fights for the ball with Bayern Munich's German forward #25 Thomas Mueller during the UEFA Champions League quarter final second leg football match between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich at the San Siro stadium in Milan on April 16, 2025. AFP While the top eight secure direct entry to the last 16, teams placed ninth to 24th must navigate an additional two-legged play-off round to join them. Arsenal, Bayern Munich, holders Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Atalanta have all already secured their places in at least the knock-out phase play-offs. This leaves a number of European heavyweights still unsure of their presence when the business end of the Champions League begins. AFP Sport looks at four big-hitters bidding to seal qualification as the league phase enters its penultimate matchday: Inter Milan Of the teams in pole position to ensure progression on matchday seven, Serie A leaders Inter face the toughest task as they must bounce back from defeat last time out against Liverpool when they take on the only team with a 100 percent record so far, Arsenal. However, Cristian Chivu's side can count on no favours from Arsenal at the San Siro on Tuesday as the Premier League leaders will be desperate to sew up a top-eight finish ahead of the final round of league phase fixtures on January 28. As the season turns the corner towards its final stretch, Chivu said after Saturday's Serie A win he believes his team is really starting to understand the way he wants them to play. \"The desire to learn from this team is remarkable,\" said the Romanian. \"What we're displaying on the pitch is a testament to the desire of these players, because it's not easy to change habits.\" One habit he won't want his players to change, however, is Inter's strong record against Arsenal, who they have bested in three of their four Champions League meetings.

On the sidelines of the signing, the two sides held talks on boosting trade and investment relations and expanding cooperation in priority sectors of mutual interest. El-Khatib said the talks build on constructive discussions held late last year, noting the strong relations, shared understanding, and common ambition between Egypt and South Korea. He pointed to the joint statement issued following the Egyptian–Korean summit on 20 November 2025, which underscored the commitment of both countries’ leaders to advance discussions on a proposed CEPA, describing Thursday’s signing as a significant milestone and a tangible step forward. The minister welcomed the successful completion of a joint feasibility study conducted under a memorandum of understanding signed in January 2022, saying the study confirms that the agreement represents a strategic opportunity to deepen economic cooperation between the two countries. El-Khatib explained that the proposed agreement would establish a comprehensive institutional framework to expand cooperation in investment, technology transfer, industrial development, capacity building, and trade liberalization, including the reduction or elimination of customs tariffs. He added that Egypt’s cabinet has approved the launch of negotiations, which will proceed in line with World Trade Organization rules and principles. He stressed that Egypt aims to ensure the negotiations deliver tangible gains in investment flows, productive cooperation, and trade expansion, highlighting the agreement’s role in encouraging greater South Korean investment in Egypt, particularly in light of major national development projects such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone. El-Khatib also said Egypt is keen to develop an integrated framework for investment cooperation with South Korea in priority sectors, including high-tech industries, agriculture, renewable energy, transport, infrastructure, and manufacturing, with a strong focus on transferring Korean expertise and know-how to Egypt. He welcomed discussions on expanding joint industrial projects based on Egypt’s availability of raw materials and manufacturing capabilities, citing sectors such as furniture, glass, artificial pearls and related inputs, crystal, marble, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, ready-made garments, electrical cables, and telecommunications products.

  "title": "Israel unbound",
  "text": "Since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Middle East has faced its most severe and consequential crisis in decades. Hamas’s egregious action demonstrated that it still posed a serious threat to Israel’s security, and the Israeli government’s reaction triggered a series of conflicts that has rattled the region. The latest Gaza war has produced a profound humanitarian catastrophe, the impact of which will be felt long after the fighting has ended. The conflict also quickly expanded into a broader war between Israel and the Iranian-anchored “Axis of Resistance,” turning Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iran, and even Qatar into battlefronts. Israel has scored important victories in each, crushing Hamas, defeating Hezbollah (by eliminating its leadership), vastly reducing Iran’s influence in the Levant, and inflicting significant damage on the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear infrastructure. Following Israel’s strike on Hamas targets in Qatar in September, the United States began pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza. But with or without one, Israel will continue to pursue expansive goals, redrawing borders in the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and southwestern Syria in ways that could further fracture its neighbors. The Axis of Resistance is, for all intents and purposes, no longer the grave threat that it once was. In its absence, the Levant is being carved into a pliable “axis of minorities,” with Alawite, Druze, Maronite, Shia, and Sunni camps competing against one another within an expanding Israeli sphere of influence. Thus, the regional balance of power that was obtained before 2023 has changed profoundly. The war has not only empowered Israel and weakened Iran, but also diminished the roles of both the US and the region’s Arab power brokers. While the US and its allies have finally led a push to end the Gaza war, it is not clear that a ceasefire and prisoner exchange will produce a viable peace agreement, and, failing that, how regional stability will be restored, or what a new regional order will look like. For the foreseeable future, the Middle East will be bracing for prolonged conflict and simmering chaos. Israel first Israel’s warmaking has not served any political goal that would unite the region or foster alliances. Its definition of regional stability is tied to its own military supremacy. But it is a mistake to think that its unrivaled capabilities will constitute a viable basis for regional order. It is more likely that Israel’s drive for supremacy will be met with new and different forms of resistance, fueling ongoing conflict. America’s role in the Middle East since the Hamas attack has been sporadic and largely reactive. Its vision for the region has not caught up with how dynamics have changed. During President Donald Trump’s first term, the US believed that regional stability could be anchored in the Gulf monarchies, with their vast economic potential. Then the Biden administration expanded on that vision, arguing that if the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, could be expanded to include Saudi Arabia and others,...",

Leaders from the 27-nation bloc will hold an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday evening to discuss their response to one of the gravest crises in years to hit transatlantic ties. \"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said. \"Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint.\" Gill said engagement with the United States continued at all levels. \"We are trying to be calm, to be firm, to be serious, to be responsible, because that's what, in our view, leadership looks like,\" Gill told reporters. But he added: \"Should the threatened tariffs be imposed, the European Union has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond.\" The EU is considering different responses if Trump does not back down, including putting the current tariff deal agreed last year with the United States on hold. Second, European tariffs on imports worth 93 billion euros ($108 billion) from the United States, currently suspended until early February, could come into force. The third response if the situation does not change would include an array of tools, including the \"anti-coercion instrument\" known as the \"bazooka\". Aides to French President Emmanuel Macron said he would ask the EU to activate the never-before-used tool against Washington if Trump makes good on his threat. \"People ask me, is the anti-coercion instrument back on the table?

But for many European governments, including America’s longest-standing and most loyal allies, Trump’s threat of punitive tariffs against anyone who tries to stop him taking Greenland was the final straw. Divorce, they believe, is now inevitable. In private, dismayed European officials describe Trump’s rush to annex the sovereign Danish territory as “crazy” and “mad,” asking if he is caught up in his “warrior mode” after his Venezuela adventure — and saying he deserves Europe’s toughest retaliation for what many see as a clear and unprovoked “attack” against allies on the other side of the Atlantic.",

There’s no Playbook Podcast and no Playbook PM newsletter today due to the federal holiday. Get in touch . Your holiday weather: It’s going to be sunny but cold across the DMV, per the Capital Weather Gang , with afternoon “highs” topping out in the mid-30s and icy wind chills making it feel an awful lot colder than that. And watch out : The harshest temperatures of the winter are headed our way tonight. Tomorrow will be “dangerously cold,” forecasters say. Layer up. Seems like a good time of year to be in … Miami, Florida, where President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will both be attending the college football playoff national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium tonight. Ali’s (deeply unscientific) Playbook survey yesterday found most of you back the Indiana Hoosiers to beat the Miami Hurricanes — and likely by a good 20 points. Let’s see how it goes. And while we’re doing football: Did you ever see anything like that from Caleb Williams ? I guess this is what happens when you have the literal pope on your side ... (Obviously it still wasn’t enough to overcome the Curse of the Honey Bears . But what a play.) NOW READ THIS: Happy anniversary! “One month after the congressionally mandated deadline to release all its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , the Justice Department has made only a fraction of the files public — and it remains silent on its plans to fully comply with the law,” POLITICO’s Hailey Fuchs writes this morning . And here’s the rub: “Also keeping quiet about the DOJ delays are congressional Republicans, almost all of whom voted in November to release the records.” What they’re saying: “I don’t give a rip about Epstein,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said last week, when asked to take stock of the month since the Dec. 19 deadline. “Like, there’s so many other things we need to be working on. I’ve done what I had to do for Epstein. Talk to somebody else about that.” Other Republicans agree it’s now just a matter for Pam Bondi’s DOJ. Watch this space.

  "title": "China’s population falls again as births drop to lowest rate since 1949 revolution",
  "text": "Measured another way, the birth rate in 2025 — 5.63 per 1,000 people — is the lowest on record since 1949, the year that Mao Zedong’s Communists overthrew the Nationalists and began running China. Figures before that, under the previous Nationalist government, were not available. China was long the world’s most populous nation until 2023, when it was surpassed by regional neighbor and sometime rival India. Monday’s statistics illustrate the stark demographic pressures faced by the country as it tries to pivot from a problem it is working hard to overcome: status as a nation with a growing but transitional economy that, as is often said, is “getting old before it gets rich.” The number of new babies born was just 7.92 million in 2025, a decline of 1.62 million, or 17%, from the previous year. The latest birth numbers show that the slight tick upward in 2024 was not a lasting trend. Births declined for seven years in a row through 2023. A man pushes a small child in a stroller along a street in Beijing on Jan. 19, 2026. | Andy Wong/AP Most families cite the costs and pressure of raising a child in a highly competitive society as significant hurdles that now loom larger in the face of an economic downturn that has impacted households struggling to meet their living costs. Across the region, “it’s these big structural issues which are much harder to tackle, whether it’s housing, and work and getting a job and getting started in life and expectations around education ...,” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, director of the Center for Aging Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “It’s gonna be difficult to make a major change in those number of births until those are addressed.” Another potential factor in the numbers, at least for 2025: Last year in China was the year of the snake, considered one of the least favored years for having a child under the Chinese zodiac. The government’s official Xinhua News Agency, however, did say early last year — perhaps optimistically — that the snake “is shaking off its negative connotations.” Like many other countries in Asia, China has faced a declining fertility rate, or the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. While the government does not regularly publish a fertility rate, last saying it was 1.3 in 2020, experts have estimated it is now around 1. Both figures are far below the 2.1 rate that would maintain the size of China’s population. For decades, the Chinese government barred people from having more than one baby and often sanctioned those who did — a policy that produced more than two generations of only children. In 2015, the government raised the permitted amount of offspring to two and then, facing demographic pressure, further revised the limit to three in 2021. The push for more births is about the economy. China now has 323 million people over 60, or 23% of the...",

  "title": "‘No bulls--t about her’: Mikie Sherrill will quickly be put to the test as New Jersey governor",
  "text": "Sherrill, who had a blowout win in November to capture a third term in a row for Democrats — a feat that has not been accomplished in six decades in the Garden State — will also have to contend with issues that have long plagued New Jersey, like rising costs and a budget that a progressive think tank said is “ full of fiscal threats .” Along with Abigail Spanberger, who was sworn in as Virginia’s governor Saturday, Sherrill will be “first up to bat” to deliver on the promise of addressing affordability that resonated with voters in November, as outgoing New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy put it. Sherrill, a 54-year-old mother of four, vowed throughout her campaign to push back against the “status quo,” and has since ushered in a Cabinet composed of new faces, some of whom are largely unknown in Trenton and others who are brand new to the state — making how they will govern an open question. When asked how she will approach the governorship, allies of Sherrill are quick to point to her stacked resume as a Navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor and a four-term member of Congress — experiences that they say provide her with the groundwork to confront these challenges, particularly from the federal government. “To know Mikie is to know: No. 1, she is super real and authentic,” said Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. “No. 2, she is a normal person, a regular person, and she understands the normal stuff that people are wrestling with and challenged by. And No. 3, she is and has had a life and a career that has been focused, disciplined and effective in problem solving, being pragmatic and getting things done.” New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy greet the audience before a conversation between Stephen Colbert Conan O’Brien to benefit Montclair Film at New Jersey Performing Arts Center on Dec. 7, 2025 in Newark, New Jersey. | Michael Loccisano/Getty Images More and more members of Congress have looked to the states to carry on their political careers, as Congress becomes exceedingly difficult to govern in — a gridlock that is acutely felt for Democrats in the minority. But Sherrill is set to enter the role on an upswing for the Democratic Party: After bruising losses across the country in 2024, Democrats had strong performances last November in response to voters’ discontent with the Trump administration. In New Jersey, she’ll have the benefit of a supermajority in the state Assembly, the largest Democratic majority since Watergate. As she ran her gubernatorial campaign, Sherrill sought to position herself as a bulwark to the president — a seemingly more aggressive stance than Murphy, who has had a relationship with Trump . But Sen. Cory Booker said that he does not think she will fight with the president for the sake of a fight, and will be open to collaborating with him. “She’s not a lightning rod in terms of her being tribal,” he...",

  "text": "Here are 25 of them: The earth’s shadow covers the full moon during a partial lunar eclipse, early Friday, Nov. 19, 2021, in Kansas City, Missouri. | Charlie Riedel/AP Space NASA fast-tracks plan to put nuclear reactor on the moon The U.S. has long eyed nuclear power as a way to unlock future space missions. NASA awarded contracts to three companies in 2022 to begin developing small nuclear reactors capable of providing power in space. The move: NASA, under former acting Administrator Sean Duffy, has greatly expedited plans to put a nuclear plant on the moon by calling for a reactor that could be ready to launch by 2030. The impact: Companies, from small start-ups to aerospace giants like Lockheed Martin, are devising plans to fill NASA’s request. The space agency has issued a call to industry , asking for information and feedback on its plans to build a fission power system. The directive orders the reactors to provide at least 100 kilowatts of power — more than double what the agency had previously envisioned. And NASA still needs to find the money for the program, which could cost billions of dollars. The upshot: NASA’s decision to speed up its nuclear reactor plans is tied to a geopolitical race with China. Both the U.S. and China are devising plans to build long-term bases on the moon, and nuclear reactors will be key to powering those outposts. China and Russia have discussed plans to jointly build a nuclear power plant on the moon by 2035, driving NASA to speed up its own plans. Officials argue that whoever does it first will write the rules of the road for space. — Audrey Decker A bitcoin ATM is seen inside the Big Apple Tobacco Shop on Feb. 8, 2021 in New York City. | Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Wall Street Crypto stablecoins gain access to banking sector Cryptocurrency evangelists have long held that digital currencies and assets, if ever given the chance, could overhaul how modern finance works. Yet from the start, the crypto world has been tarnished by frauds, wild swings and crashes and skepticism from Washington policymakers that have stymied its ability to prove its worth. Now, Trump — a digital assets skeptic-turned-champion — has set the stage for crypto to finally do exactly that, and potentially transform the systems Americans use to pay for everything from financial assets and cars to pizza. The move: In July, Trump, surrounded by a crowd of crypto’s biggest names at the White House, signed into law the GENIUS Act — an historic, bipartisan bill that set up a new regulatory framework for a type of crypto token known as stablecoins. Pegged in value to assets like the dollar, stablecoins currently play a critical role in the trading that happens across the crypto markets. The bill’s adoption into law set the stage for the mainstream adoption of stablecoins across Wall Street, an evolution that could, ultimately, result in a world where consumers are buying their...",

The White House lobbied these lawmakers heavily to take their names off the discharge petition to compel the bill’s consideration, with administration officials at one point summoning Boebert to the Situation Room for a final plea. Now Washington’s attention has since shifted to other political firestorms, from Trump’s military action in Venezuela to the shooting of a U.S. citizen by an ICE agent in Minnesota, and congressional Republicans are eager to move on — underscoring the extent to which the GOP remains wary of crossing swords with the president. The public falling out between Greene and Trump was largely over Greene’s support for releasing the Epstein files — Trump called her a “traitor” — and ultimately culminated in Greene’s resignation from the House earlier this month. Trump vetoed a bill that would have supported a water infrastructure project in Boebert’s district , and administration officials privately warned Mace that her defiance would likely to cost her the president’s endorsement in the South Carolina governor’s race. Mace has vowed on social media to “ keep fighting ” for justice for Epstein’s victims but has not otherwise continued the drumbeat against the Justice Department. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who has worked with Democrats on a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation into the Epstein case, said in a recent interview she’s now more more focused on holding Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress for not honoring the panel’s subpoena to testify about Epstein. Many of the photos released by the DOJ so far feature the former president consorting with Epstein, and the administration has sought to portray Bill Clinton as the real pariah , not Trump. Both men have denied wrongdoing, and neither has been implicated in Epstein’s crimes. Pressed on the delays in releasing more records, Luna said the initial deadline was not “realistic” and that “I’m not going to rush the process on that — we’re going to get them.” House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) is also defending the administration. “From my standpoint, the Department of Justice is cooperating,” he told reporters after Bill Clinton defied his subpoena to testify last week. “They are turning over documents. We would all like for them to turn documents over quicker, but at the end of the day, they are complying.” Not only has the administration failed to fully release Epstein records...",

  "title": "Poll finds Americans not satisfied with handling of Epstein files",
  "text": "Following bipartisan calls to release the Epstein files throughout Trump’s first year back in office, Congress passed a law in November requiring the DOJ to release by mid-December all documents tied to Epstein, the late convicted sex offender with ties to several wealthy individuals. In late December, the DOJ said they had identified potentially more than a million documents connected to the investigations into Epstein that have yet to be released. The CNN poll found Americans do not trust the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein investigation documents, with 67 percent saying they believe the government is intentionally holding back information that should be released, while 16 percent said the government is making an effort to release all information possible. The documents released thus far have offered nominal details about Trump’s relationship to Epstein, whom the president has acknowledged socializing with previously. Trump has said he ended their friendship after Epstein “stole people” who worked at his Mar-a-Lago club and has denied any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein. Among the documents already released are images of well-known figures alongside Epstein, including Trump. Former President Bill Clinton appeared in multiple photos as part of an initial release of documents. A spokesperson for the former president accused the Trump administration of selectively including photos of Clinton, a longtime Trump political foe, and denied Clinton’s involvement in any wrongdoing. The timeline for the release of further documents is unclear after the DOJ’s delaying its release of all the Epstein documents. But despite the clamor from members on both sides of the aisle for transparency, some Republicans who called for the documents to be released are downplaying the government’s failure to release all Epstein materials in compliance with federal law. The CNN poll was conducted from Jan. 9 to Jan. 12, via phone and online surveys of 1,209 adults. The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

  "title": "Why Bernice King sees MLK Day as a ‘saving grace’ in today’s political climate",
  "text": "King, CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, cited efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; directives to scrub key parts of history from government websites and remove “improper ideology” from Smithsonian museums; and immigration enforcement operations in multiple cities that have turned violent and resulted in the separation of families. “Everything President Trump does is in the best interest of the American people,” White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in an email. “That includes rolling back harmful DEI agendas, deporting dangerous criminal illegal aliens from American communities, or ensuring we are being honest about our country’s great history.” Civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. addresses a meeting in Chicago on May 27, 1966. | Jeff Kamen/Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said King’s words “ring more true today.” “We’re at a period in our history where we literally have a regime actively working to erase the Civil Rights movement,” she said. “This has been an administration dismantling intentionally and with ideological fervor every advancement we have made since the Civil War.” Wiley also recalled that King warned that “the prospect of war abroad was undermining to the beloved community globally and it was taking away from the ability for us to take care of all our people.” Trump’s administration has engaged in military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats and captured Venezuela’s president in a surprise raid earlier this month. Bernice King said she’s not sure what her father would make of the United States today, nearly six decades after his assassination. “He’s not here. It’s a different world,” she said. “But what I can say is his teachings transcend time and he taught us, I think, the way to address injustice through his nonviolent philosophy and methodology.” Nonviolence should be embraced not just by those who are protesting and fighting against what they believe are injustices, but should also be adopted by immigration agents and other law enforcement officers, she said. To that end, she added, the King Center previously developed a curriculum that it now plans to redevelop to help officers see that they can carry out their duties while also respecting people’s humanity. Andrew Young talks with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as King was about to be returned to jail in St. Augustine, Florida, on June 12, 1964. King had been arrested the day before for trying to eat at the Monson Motor Lodge restaurant. | AP Even amid the “troubling climate” in the country right now, Bernice King said there is no question that “we have made so much progress as a nation.” The civil rights movement that her parents helped lead brought more people into mainstream politics who have sensitivity and compassion, she said.

  "title": "Pence: ‘Delcy Rodríguez is not the right leader’ for Venezuela",
  "text": "Rodríguez, a strong supporter of Maduro, has been serving as the Venezuela president since Jan. 3. Following Maduro’s capture, Trump threw his support behind her, referring to Rodríguez as a “terrific person” and saying the interim president will “make Venezuela great again.” Pence’s criticism of Rodríguez comes shortly after the Associated Press reported that Rodríguez has been labeled a “priority target” of the Drug Enforcement Administration since 2022 and just days after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado met with Trump . Though the White House has said its goal is to establish fair elections in Venezuela, it is unclear when the next election will occur. Administration officials have repeatedly said it is too soon to know as the country continues to reel from Maduro’s capture. Still, Sen. John Cornyn told “Fox News Sunday” that Trump “has multiple levers to use with Delcy Rodriguez.” “The president said that we’ve learned the lessons from Iraq that collapsing the existing governing regime and creating an insurgency can result in a long war that they are trying to avoid in Venezuela,” the Texas Republican said. Pence’s criticism of the president also extended to his strategy for controlling Greenland. Though there is an “absolute” national security interest in controlling and ultimately owning the Denmark-owned territory, Pence said, he is concerned about how Trump plans to go about achieving that control. “I have concerns about using what I think is a questionable constitutional authority, imposing unilateral tariffs on NATO allies, to achieve this objective,” Pence said, referring to a 10 percent tariff imposed on eight European countries opposing Trump’s attempts to gain control of Greenland . “I do think that the current posture, which I hope will change and abate, does threaten to fracture that strong relationship not just with Denmark, but with all of our NATO allies,” Pence added. Cornyn said that while Greenland is “strategically located,” he believes any military action is not in the cards at this time. “Greenland and the Danes have been our allies for a long time now,” Cornyn told “Fox News Sunday.” “President Trump is the dealmaker, and I expect him to make a deal.”",

  "title": "Кого из российских теннисистов считают фаворитом на Australian Open",
  "text": "18 января в Мельбурне стартует основная сетка первого в сезоне турнира «Большого шлема». Кто является фаворитом и каковы шансы российских теннисистов Australian Open — в материале «РБК Спорт» Australian Open, первый в сезоне турнира «Большого шлема», пройдет с 12 января по 1 февраля в Мельбурне на харде. Среди женщин действующей победительницей является американка Мэдисон Киз, а среди мужчин — итальянец Янник Синнер. Из россиян в прошлом сезоне лучший результат показали Карен Хачанов (третий круг) и Анастасия Павлюченкова (четвертьфинал). Розыгрыш основной сетки турнира стартует 18 января. В нем примут участие десять россиян: трое мужчин и семь женщин. Соперники россиян rbc.group Первая ракетка России Даниил Медведев начнет Australian Open матчем с голландцем Йеспером де Йонгом. Трехкратный финалист Australian Open Медведев занимает 12-е место в рейтинге Ассоциации теннисистов-профессионалов (ATP), де Йонг — 73-е. Ранее они не играли друг с другом в ATP. Андрей Рублев (14-й) в первом круге сыграет с итальянцем Маттео Арнальди (65-й), Карен Хачанов (17-й) — с американцем Алексом Микелсеном (37-й). Рублев выиграл у Арнальди две встречи из четырех, Хачанов у Микелсена — одну из двух. Лучшая из российских теннисисток Мирра Андреева (8-я в WTA) начнет турнир встречей с хорваткой Донной Векич (70-я). Диана Шнайдер (23-я) сыграет с чешкой Барборой Крейчиковой, Анна Калинская (33-я) — с британкой Сонай Картал, Людмила Самсонова (18-я) — с немкой Лаурой Зигемунд, Екатерина Александрова (11-я) — с турчанкой Зейнеп Сонмез, Анастасия Павлюченкова (44-я) — с китаянкой Бай Чжосюань, Анастасия Захарова (103-я) получила в соперницы шестую ракетку мира Джессику Пегулу (США). Рекордные призовые Общий призовой фонд Открытого чемпионата Австралии с прошлого года увеличился более чем на 16%. Теперь сумма составляет $74,89 млн. Наибольший рост (на 19%) зафиксирован для победителей в одиночных разрядах, которые получат по $2,79 млн. Финалистам достанутся по $1,44 млн, полуфиналистам — по $840 тыс., четвертьфиналистам — по $504 тыс. При этом в сравнении с турнирами «Большого шлема» прошлого года призовые на Australian Open превышают лишь сумму «Ролан Гаррос — 2025» ($66 млн), но значительно меньше Уимблдона ($72,6 млн) и US Open ($90 млн) 2025 года. Призовые в одиночном разряде Australian Open 2026 Первый круг — $100,7 тыс.; Второй круг — $150,7 тыс.; Третий круг — $219,53 тыс.; Четвертый круг — $321,5 тыс.; Четвертьфинал — $504 тыс.; Полуфинал — $840 тыс.; Финал — $1,44 млн; Чемпион — $2,79 млн. Фавориты турниры Одними из главных фаворитов турнира являются вторая ракетка мира итальянец Янник Синнер, который на последнем Australian Open в трех сетах победил представителя Германии Александра Зверева. Испанец Карлос Алькарас, занимающий первое место в мировом рейтинге также является одним из лидеров соревнования. Лучшим результатом теннисиста на турнире является 1/4 финала в 2024 и 2025 годах. Третья ракетка мира, представляющий Германию Александр Зверев, неплохо выступает на Открытом чемпионате Австралии — он трижды доходил до полуфинала турнира. А в последний раз — дошел до финала. Среди россиян главным претендентом на победу является Даниил Медведев. 12-я ракетка мира ни разу не выигрывал Australian Open, но трижды доходил до финала. В 2021-м он в трех сетах уступил Джоковичу, в 2022 году упустил победу против Рафаэля Надаля, а в прошлом году...",

Entre les deux, « rien n'est exclu », a éludé dimanche la porte-parole du gouvernement Maud Bregeon.

  "text": "Les retards ne découragent pas la SNCF. Malgré les délais de livraison du TGV nouvelle génération, qui se comptent désormais en années, elle continue de faire confiance à Alstom et de planifier son expansion sur les liaisons européennes à grande vitesse. L'opérateur ferroviaire public a annoncé lundi avoir signé une nouvelle commande de 15 exemplaires du TGV-M, la cinquième génération du train français à grande vitesse, soit un contrat supplémentaire d'environ 600 millions d'euros, pour des livraisons prévues à partir de 2029. Ces nouveaux trains à deux étages et quadricourant, aptes à circuler dans les principaux réseaux européens, sont principalement destinés « au développement de son offre entre les métropoles françaises et la Belgique », selon la SNCF. Sous-entendu : pas seulement au départ de Paris. Déjà 160 rames commandées chez Alstom La desserte de Munich, en coopération avec la Deutsche Bahn, est aussi sur ses plans à court terme, mais la SNCF ne l'évoque pas dans son communiqué. Cette nouvelle commande, qui sera financée entièrement sur fonds propres par la compagnie nationale, porte au total à 160 le nombre de TGV-M achetés chez Alstom. Publicité Après sa première commande initiale de 100 « TGV du futur » passée en 2018, l'entreprise avait retenu 15 unités supplémentaires pour son projet sur les lignes domestiques italiennes à compter de 2027, puis récemment 30 exemplaires fermes pour Eurostar, soit un total de 145 rames.

D'autres clients ont aussi retenu chez Alstom ces trains nommés Avelia Horizon par le constructeur, à savoir les chemins de fer du Maroc (18 unités) et la future compagnie privée française Velvet (12). Tous ces trains seront assemblés sur les sites français d'Alstom (10 sur un total de 14), et le constructeur a récemment développé son outil de production national pour remédier à des goulets d'étranglement industriels. Le second constructeur mondial du ferroviaire commence 2026 sur les chapeaux de roues, puisqu'il vient de signer par ailleurs tout récemment deux autres contrats : 70 rames de métro pour l'agglomération canadienne de Toronto (une valeur de 1,4 milliard d'euros) et 26 trains régionaux Coradia supplémentaires pour le Land allemand du Bade-Wurtemberg (soit 500 millions d'euros).

  "text": "49.3 ou ordonnances ? Pour le parti socialiste, il n'y a plus de suspense. L'hypothèse d'un recours aux ordonnances pour adopter le budget 2026 est « sans objet dès lors qu'on s'achemine vers la possibilité d'une non-censure », elle serait même « hasardeuse », a estimé le chef des députés socialistes Boris Vallaud ce lundi, sur RTL. A l'inverse, le 49.3, « je crois que c'est ce vers quoi on s'oriente », a-t-il ajouté. Le Parti socialiste, qui détient une bonne partie des clés de la censure, s'est montré satisfait des annonces gouvernementales vendredi soir. Parmi elles, plusieurs mesures sur le pouvoir d'achat, dont une hausse de la prime d'activité, mais également sur la jeunesse, avec les repas à un euro pour les étudiants. C'est également la proposition PS de surtaxe sur les bénéfices de 300 grandes entreprises qui a été retenue in fine, pour un rendement de 8 milliards d'euros en 2026, comme en 2025. « Nous avons fait oeuvre utile […] Nous avons fait reculer le gouvernement sur un certain nombre de points qui étaient une politique injuste pour les Français pour lesquels les fins de mois étaient difficiles », a souligné Boris Vallaud. Compte tenu de ces « avancées », le PS peut « envisager une non-censure », a-t-il souligné. « La honte et le remords politique » Publicité Ces propos n'ont pas suffi à rassurer Amélie de Montchalin, qui, sur BFMTV, a maintenu la pression sur le parti socialiste. La ministre des Comptes publics a insisté sur la nécessité, pour son gouvernement, d'obtenir des garanties supplémentaires de non-censure. « Ce qu'on veut, c'est sauver le budget. Ce qui se joue dans les ultimes tractations c'est : est-ce qu'on a assez de garanties pour prendre plutôt le chemin du fameux 49.3 ? », s'est-elle interrogée, rappelant qu'il s'agissait d'un « chemin assez périlleux ». « S'il ne se passe pas bien, à la fin vous n'avez ni budget mais vous n'avez même plus de gouvernement pour reproposer un budget. Donc vous n'avez rien », a-t-elle rappelé. A l'inverse, les ordonnances permettent « au moins » d'avoir un budget, « même s'il ne plaît à personne ».

Au second tour, dimanche prochain, la ministre, qui fait face ces dernières semaines à la grève des médecins libéraux, sera opposée à la candidate du Rassemblement National (RN) Tiffanie Rabault, qui a recueilli 27,2 % des voix. Ce duel aura des airs de déjà-vu. Les deux femmes s'étaient affrontées au second tour en 2024. Stéphanie Rist s'était largement imposée avec 67,68 % contre 32,32 % pour la candidate RN. En juillet 2024, Stéphanie Rist avait bénéficié du désistement de Ghislaine Kounowski pour faire barrage à la candidate RN.

La baisse est ainsi de rigueur à Tokyo ou bien encore à Hong Kong avec des reculs respectifs de 0,97 % pour le Nikkei (-0,47 % pour le Topix) et de 1,05 % pour l'indice Hang Seng. La Bourse de Sydney était aussi dans le rouge avec un repli de 0,40 %. A Séoul, au contraire, après avoir démarré dans le rouge, le marché s'est repris et était finalement nettement orienté à la hausse avec une progression de près de 1,3 %.

  "title": "L'économie chinoise a atteint les 5 % de croissance en 2025 mais reste sous pression",
  "text": "Sur le papier, l'objectif est atteint, comme d'habitude ou presque. En 2025, la Chine a enregistré une croissance de 5 % de son PIB, selon les chiffres officiels publiés ce lundi, en ligne avec l'objectif « d'environ 5 % » que Pékin s'était fixé pour l'année. Après les 5 % en 2024, la deuxième économie mondiale sauve donc à nouveau les meubles, mais uniquement grâce à la demande extérieure. Face aux droits de douane de Donald Trump, les industriels chinois ont exporté comme jamais vers l'Europe et le reste du monde, offrant à Pékin un surplus commercial record de 1.200 milliards de dollars sur l'année. Sur le plan intérieur, en revanche, l'économie chinoise continue de ralentir, prise en étau entre une offre surabondante et une demande trop faible. De quoi augurer des turbulences pour 2026, au moment où la guerre commerciale sino-américaine pourrait repartir après les dernières menaces de Donald Trump sur l'Iran, et alors que de nombreux clients de la Chine érigent des barrières douanières pour se protéger de la machine industrielle chinoise. Le promoteur Vanke au bord de la faillite Publicité Les seuls chiffres du quatrième trimestre indiquent en effet que le ralentissement s'accentue : entre octobre et décembre, le PIB chinois a progressé de 4,5 %, contre 4,8 % au troisième trimestre, 5,2 % au deuxième trimestre et 5,4 % au premier trimestre. Il s'agit de la plus faible croissance depuis trois ans, lorsque le pays, en décembre 2022, avait abandonné sa stricte politique « zéro-Covid » -- un choc dont la Chine ne s'est jamais relevée. « Mises bout à bout, ces données reflètent l'écart persistant dans l'économie entre la force des exportations et la faiblesse de la demande domestique », écrit Goldman Sachs dans une note. Lire aussi : La Chine et le Canada scellent leurs retrouvailles avec une série d'accords La Chine est toujours engluée dans une crise immobilière sévère qui a érodé la confiance des ménages et fait chuter par conséquent la consommation, dans ce pays où la quasi-totalité de l'épargne est logée dans la pierre. L'année dernière, les investissements dans l'immobilier ont chuté de plus de 17 %. Après Evergrande et Country Garden, un troisième géant du secteur, le promoteur Vanke, pourrait faire faillite à son tour s'il ne parvient pas à renégocier ses échéances de dette qu'il repousse de jour en jour. La situation est particulièrement grave dans les petites villes de province où les prix de l'immobilier ont littéralement plongé. Plan quinquennal Dans ce contexte, la consommation continue d'être déprimée et peine à absorber le trop-plein d'offre. En décembre, la production dans l'industrie et les services ont chacune progressé de plus de 5 %. Mais les ventes au détail, elles, ont ralenti à 0,9 % -- contre 1,3 % en novembre et 2,9 % en octobre. Pour enrayer ce déclin, la Chine avait distribué en 2025 des coupons, d'un montant total équivalent à 37 milliards d'euros, pour que les Chinois puissent renouveler leur électroménager, partir en vacances, aller au restaurant...",

  "text": "L'équation budgétaire conserve une dernière part d'inconnu. En dévoilant vendredi sa « nouvelle copie » du projet de loi de finances (PLF) 2026, le Premier ministre Sébastien Lecornu a énuméré une longue liste de concessions en direction du Parti socialiste - qui semble désormais prêt à ne pas le censurer -, du bloc central et des Républicains. Mais tout en rappelant sa volonté de contenir le déficit sous les 5 % du PIB, Sébastien Lecornu s'est gardé de préciser la manière dont ces annonces seraient financées, alors que leur total avoisine les 8 milliards d'euros selon nos calculs. Le Premier ministre prévoit d'écrire ce lundi aux parlementaires pour leur détailler les modalités de son plan, qui reste en partie mystérieux, en particulier sur la partie fiscale. « On ne peut à la fois multiplier les dépenses, promettre un déficit contenu et affirmer qu'il n'y aura aucune conséquence fiscale », s'est inquiété sur X le président du groupe Horizons à l'Assemblée, Paul Christophe. Aucune marge de manoeuvre sur le déficit Publicité Le gouvernement n'a aucune marge de manoeuvre sur le déficit. La copie initiale du PLF 2026 visait un solde public à 4,7 % du PIB, mais la dégradation des comptes issue de l'adoption du budget de la Sécurité sociale et l'absence de vote du PLF avant le 31 décembre 2025, qui a rendu inapplicables certaines mesures fiscales en raison du principe de non-rétroactivité (comme la réforme de l'abattement des retraités), portent déjà le déficit à 5 %. Vendredi soir, le Premier ministre a annoncé trois mesures très coûteuses : le dégel du barème de l'impôt sur le revenu (1,9 milliard), la hausse de la prime d'activité (applicable sur trois trimestres selon la ministre des Comptes publics Amélie de Montchalin, pour 1,5 milliard environ) et le renoncement au rabot sur les allègements de charges (1,5 milliard).

  "title": "EXCLUSIF - La lettre de Sébastien Lecornu pour tenter d'apaiser les chefs d'entreprise sur le budget",
  "text": "Les représentants patronaux ont souvent manifesté leur dépit devant l'interminable feuilleton budgétaire. L'épilogue risque aussi de leur laisser un goût amer. Comme l'ont révélé « Les Echos », afin de financer les ultimes concessions sur le projet de loi de finances (PLF) 2026, la surtaxe sur les bénéfices des grandes entreprises sera ainsi finalement maintenue au même niveau qu'en 2025, au lieu d'être divisée par deux. Dans ce contexte, le Premier ministre, Sébastien Lecornu, a décidé de prendre la plume pour tenter d'apaiser les entrepreneurs dans un courrier de trois pages, transmis par Matignon aux « Echos ». « Mesdames et Messieurs les chefs d'entreprise, », écrit le Premier ministre, « votre première attente était la visibilité. […] Ce message a été entendu. » Sébastien Lecornu rappelle l'adoption du budget de la Sécurité sociale, qui n'est certes « pas parfait », mais ramène le déficit des comptes sociaux sous les 20 milliards d'euros et assure le bon fonctionnement du modèle social. Le choix de la « stabilité » Sébastien Lecornu souligne ensuite les principes qui ont guidé ses choix dans le PLF et justifie quelques décisions perçues douloureusement par les entrepreneurs. « L'impératif fondamental est de réduire le déficit à 5 % du PIB, sans casser la cohésion sociale, ni la croissance. […] 2026 sera une année de stabilité pour les entreprises françaises, avec une attention toute particulière portée aux PME, ainsi qu'aux entreprises de taille intermédiaire (ETI), qui constituent l'ossature productive du pays », écrit-il. Publicité Dans un contexte budgétaire contraint, entre renoncer aux économies sur les allègements de charges et baisser la cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises (CVAE), il a fallu choisir. La préservation du coût du travail a été « priorisée », admet le Premier ministre « au détriment, malheureusement, de la baisse de la CVAE qui figurait dans le texte initial. […] Je reste néanmoins persuadé qu'il faudra demain poursuivre la baisse de la CVAE », insiste Sébastien Lecornu. Lire aussi : EDITO - Budget 2026 : c'est Noël en janvier (hélas) ! Le Premier ministre souligne comme un avantage la stabilité des règles fiscales. « Il n'y a pas de modification des dispositifs existants, pas de remise en cause des équilibres connus, pas d'instabilité normative », relève-t-il. Mais pour les grandes entreprises, cette stabilité se traduira surtout par le maintien des règles de la surtaxe sur les bénéfices (que François Bayrou s'était engagé à stopper), à l'exception des ETI qui en seront épargnées, confirme-t-il. Un budget « bon pour l'économie » « Pour les très grandes entreprises - au nombre d'environ 300 - le gouvernement reprend le barème arrêté pour 2025 », écrit-il. Pour donner « un sens clair et une portée nationale » à cette contribution, l'argent récolté « contribuera directement au financement de l'accélération de notre trajectoire de défense, indique le Premier ministre. C'est une expression concrète de leur patriotisme économique, et nous les en remercions. » Pas sûr que cela suffise à faire passer la pilule, d'autant qu'il s'agit aussi...",

  "text": "Dans une économie dirigiste, les mouvements boursiers ne sont jamais tout à fait naturels. En fin de semaine dernière, les fonds cotés en Bourse (ETF) chinois ont essuyé des décollectes record. Sur la seule journée de jeudi, le Huatai-Pinebridge CSI 300 ETF a perdu environ 20 milliards de yuans (2,9 milliards de dollars ou 2,5 milliards d'euros), un montant inédit depuis son lancement en 2012, selon les données Bloomberg. D'autres ETF, comme le E Fund CSI 300 ETF et ChinaAMC CSI 300 ETF, ont connu le même sort. A l'origine de ces ventes massives se trouve un pool d'investisseurs institutionnels publics, orchestré par Pékin depuis plusieurs années pour réguler les marchés. Au total, ces acteurs ont vendu plus de 10 milliards de dollars de ces ETF jeudi dernier. L'objectif ? Freiner le rallye boursier alimenté par l'enthousiasme autour de l'intelligence artificielle, à l'oeuvre depuis l'effet « DeepSeek » apparu il y a un an, et l'optimisme sur les résultats d'entreprises. Ce mouvement intervient d'ailleurs au lendemain d'un resserrement surprise des conditions de financement, resté sans effet sur les marchés. Outil de stimulation Publicité Les Bourses de Hong Kong et de la Chine continentale se sont inscrites en forte hausse l'an dernier, portées à la fois par les promesses de l'IA et l'apaisement des tensions commerciales avec les Etats-Unis. En 2025, l'indice Hang Seng a gagné 28 % et le CSI 300 a pris 18 %, sa plus forte hausse depuis 2020. Depuis le début de l'année, ils s'inscrivent respectivement en progression de 5 % et 2,2 %. Spécialisé dans la technologie, l'indice ChiNext s'est de son côté envolé de près de 63 % en un an. Pour Pékin, il est temps de calmer le jeu pour ne pas s'exposer à un dégonflement trop brutal d'une éventuelle bulle, notamment sur les « techs ». Lire aussi : DECRYPTAGE - La « bulle du siècle » de la tech américaine ne fait pas encore cauchemarder les stars du trading Initialement utilisés pour doper les marchés après leur déroute entre les années 2021 et 2023, qui avaient vu le CSI 300 perdre quasiment la moitié de sa valeur, les ETF sont devenus un véritable instrument de stabilisation. Le pool d'institutionnels détient les plus importants ETF en actions sur les indices CSI 500 et CSI 1000, qui peuvent donc avoir un effet immédiat sur les marchés. Selon Bloomberg, le fonds souverain du pays, la China Investment Corporation, détenait mi-2025 plus d'un quart des encours des ETF chinois. Au-delà de leur effet immédiat sur les cours, ces ventes d'ETF constituent aussi un signal politique envoyé aux investisseurs. En intervenant non plus pour soutenir, mais pour freiner le marché, les autorités chinoises rappellent qu'elles entendent garder la main sur le rythme et la nature du redressement boursier. Cette gestion « à la manette » vise à éviter la formation de bulles spéculatives, tout en maintenant la Bourse dans un rôle d'outil au service de la politique économique, notamment pour financer les secteurs jugés stratégiques.

Olivier Faure appelle à la non-censure après les arbitrages, il est vrai très socialistes, rendus par Sébastien Lecornu sur le budget. Le bloc central s'étrangle - cela commence à faire beaucoup - mais ne fera rien contre l'adoption du budget : il est temps de passer à autre chose. Même Yaël Braun-Pivet, présidente de l'Assemblée, qui y était très hostile, ne dit rien contre le 49.3. « Ce n'est pas à moi de choisir » (RTL). Les cases cochées, la voie se dégage, Sébastien Lecornu est en train de « renoncer à son renoncement » sur le 49.3, comme le dit Xavier Bertrand. Faute d'accord au Parlement, le Premier ministre avait d'abord travaillé à un scénario d'ordonnances, Olivier Faure étant d'accord, avant de constater qu'elles étaient vécues comme beaucoup plus violentes par une partie de l'Assemblée. L'hostilité de François Hollande et Philippe Brun a marqué. Va donc pour ce 49.3 contre lequel il s'était politiquement construit. « L'arme de la nuisance » Si du moins le Sénat, à majorité de droite, ne se met pas en travers du chemin, comme il le peut théoriquement, lorsque le texte lui reviendra. Que disent Gérard Larcher, Bruno Retailleau, Hervé Marseille du budget dessiné vendredi ? Rien, les cases sont vides, ou floues, ce qui revient au même. Publicité Le Premier ministre qui a délibérément mis le Sénat au second plan depuis son arrivée à Matignon - c'est l'Assemblée qui pouvait le faire tomber - se voit rattrapé par son talon d'Achille. Sa maison se rebiffe, reste délibérément incertaine, histoire de gagner des arbitrages et de rappeler qu'elle existe. « Il nous reste l'arme de la nuisance, il faut a minima baisser la contribution des collectivités locales », affirme Hervé Marseille.

  "title": "Canada takes step to grow EV market and strengthen auto sector",
  "text": "TORONTO — ADAM THORN, director of the transportation program at the Pembina Institute, made the following statement in response to today’s announcement regarding tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles . “Canada is opening its market to more Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), allowing 49,000 EVs at a 6.1% tariff rate. The quota will rise about 6% per year, reaching 70,000 within five years, with half of the 2030 quota reserved for EVs priced under $35,000. This is a relatively small fraction of the 1.7 million vehicles sold in Canada in 2024, but it reflects the government’s efforts to make EVs more affordable for Canadians while balancing consumer choice, climate goals and long-term competitiveness in the auto sector. “This is a positive step that helps make EVs more affordable for Canadians at a time when cost remains the biggest barrier to adoption. EVs can save consumers up to $40,000 per vehicle over 10 years on average, thanks to lower maintenance and fuel costs. Allowing more lower-priced EVs into the Canadian market supports consumer choice and helps unlock demand, ensuring Canadians have access to the same range of EVs already available in other major markets. It also aligns Canada with where global automakers and consumers are already headed, as EV adoption rapidly accelerates globally. Transportation accounts for 22% of Canada’s emissions, second to oil and gas, making EV adoption a critical part of achieving Canada’s climate goals. “Strong and sustained EV demand is essential to the long-term competitiveness of our auto sector. When affordability improves, demand follows, attracting investment, supporting innovation and securing good-paying jobs across the EV supply chain. Complementary measures, such as the EV Availability Standard (EVAS), are essential regulations within Canada’s broader EV strategy. They help bring down vehicle costs, support consumer demand for EVs and keep the auto industry competitive by aligning Canada with global markets. The slow increase in import quotas creates competition to encourage automakers operating in Canada to produce low-cost EVs. If EV adoption slows because prices remain out of reach, or in the absence of reliable long-term policy certainty, investment decisions and production timelines are put at risk, slowing the growth of Canada’s EV sector and the jobs it supports. “Growing EV demand in Canada also underpins the case for building out Canada’s supply chains, including battery critical minerals, where Canada has a real economic opportunity to compete. EVs are a leading driver of new demand for the minerals used in batteries. Without a growing EV market, that demand and the opportunity it creates for Canada would be much smaller. “The Canadian automotive manufacturing sector is under pressure. The source of that pressure is U.S. trade policy, not Canadian regulation designed to increase the availability of zero-emission vehicles, such as the EVAS, or the entrance of a small number of Chinese vehicles. Over 80% of the vehicles manufactured in Canada are exported to the U.S., leaving the industry exposed to U.S. volatility. Canada’s next step must be to engage strategically with China to secure manufacturing partnerships...",

  "title": "A year in review: the transition to clean energy in remote communities",
  "text": "Remote community energy systems are evolving, and 2025 — a year marked by major reports, project millstones, and bold announcements — is proof of this. Yet, with a new government and economic uncertainty reshaping our collective priorities, the context for remote energy development will only continue to evolve both quickly and significantly. To reflect on what’s next, we’ve highlighted five key developments from 2025 and what they could mean for the future of clean energy in Canada’s most remote regions. 1. A renewed focus on the North Canada’s military sector is set to receive billions of dollars in federal spending and investment in the coming years – much of which will focus on the Arctic. With so many remote Indigenous communities spread across the Arctic, we cannot overstate the impact of growing interest in and attention to the North. But what will this mean for renewable energy and diesel reduction? One issue we’re paying more attention to is the increasing demands on already stressed local energy systems. More military bases, training hubs, and research will require more labour and more housing. All of this will require more energy – but most northern communities (including every community in Nunavut) heavily rely on aging and inefficient diesel generators for heat and electricity. For years, urgent updates have been required to minimize inefficiencies, pollution, cost, and noise. 2026 must be the year we make real progress on the infrastructure gap and build a resilient energy future for the North. WATCH: Want Arctic security? Nunavummiut say invest in Canada’s North (CBC News: The National) 2. Major projects and the local leaders that drive them The federal government’s strategy for building out community and major infrastructure has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been at the top of our minds this past year. At least three proposed major projects could have significant implications for the future of diesel consumption in the Yukon and Nunavut. One of these projects, the Iqaluit Nukkiksautit Project, has already been designated a project in the national interest and, pending regulatory approval, is projected to reduce 15 million L of diesel in Nunavut annually. As we wrote in 2025, this is a transformative project driven by a known local Inuit proponent ; their work tells an important and inspiring story about the potential that comes from investing in local clean energy leadership. From transmission lines and hydro projects to transportation and ports, we must not forget the active role that local clean energy leaders play in building healthy communities and environments. Nor can we forget the necessity of shared benefits that support thriving and healthy communities. A growing network of local leaders are showing what it takes to meet these ambitions – now is not the time to abandon them . In 2026, we will continue to highlight the important role local leaders play in shaping efficient and beneficial energy futures for all. The federal government’s strategy for building out community and major infrastructure has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been at the top of our minds this...",

  "text": "CALGARY — CHRIS SEVERSON-BAKER, executive director of the Pembina Institute, made the following statement in response to the January 8 letter sent by Premier of Alberta Danielle Smith to Prime Minister Mark Carney: “Just over a month after the MOU was signed, Alberta has sought to recast the issues in light of the US’s recent actions in Venezuela. The letter includes speculative suggestions about the possible impact on global oil markets, trade flows, and Alberta’s oil industry – and therefore on the trajectory of the ongoing climate policy negotiations between Alberta and Ottawa.   “Alberta using this moment to lobby in public against what it is now calling an ‘overly aggressive’ industrial carbon price raises more questions about the outcome Alberta has in mind – especially given it already agreed in the MOU to strengthen its system. This is in addition to the regulatory changes Alberta pushed through in December – days after signing the MOU – that weakened its industrial carbon pricing system and effectively moved the goalposts on the negotiation before it had begun.     “Nobody can predict how events in Venezuela will play out over the next few years. If anything, the situation underscores the extent to which Canada is vulnerable to the whims of other nations, whose actions dictate global oil prices and, therefore, the competitiveness of Canadian oil exports. This highlights the level of risk involved in increasing our country’s economic reliance on revenues from oil and gas exports, especially with a global supply glut on the horizon and widespread projections of global demand stagnation within the next decade.   “Far from being a reason to further expedite a pipeline proposal and weaken Canadian climate policy, the Venezuela situation should give further pause for thought and reassessment about the best economic bet for Canada going forward.” [30] Contact Alex Burton Director, Communications, Pembina Institute 825-994-2557 ​​​Background Op-ed: MOU negotiations will hinge on whether Alberta comes to the table in good faith  The Pembina Institute acknowledges that the work we steward and those we serve spans across many Nations. In the spirit of truth, justice, reconciliation, and to contribute to a more equitable and inclusive future for all of society, please see our path towards Reconciliation and prioritizing Indigenous leadership.",

  "text": "CALGARY — CHRIS SEVERSON-BAKER, Executive Director of the Pembina Institute, made the following statement in response to the federal government’s announcement of its second batch of major projects to be referred to its Major Projects Office:“Today’s announcement recognizes the moral and economic imperative in readying Canada to lead in the low-carbon world, even as some of the new projects will result in significant increases in emissions.“The North Coast Transmission Line is a positive development, as Canada needs a major increase in electricity infrastructure – generation, transmission, modernization, and distribution – to meet surging demand and set us up for success in what global energy authorities call the Age of Electricity. This project is a step toward connecting the Yukon grid to the B.C. grid, increasing the reliability and affordability of electricity in both regions, and reducing the need for fossil fuel-based back-up systems. That said, clean low-cost electricity is a finite resource and should be prioritized for uses that provide the most value to Canadians over time. While electrifying a critical mineral mine might be a productive use, electrifying power-hungry LNG terminals may represent a serious opportunity cost.“On critical minerals (Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project, Nouveau Monde Graphite’s Matawinie Mine, Northcliff Resources’ Sisson Mine), while mining operations have the potential to be large emitters, the federal government is right to recognize critical mineral development as a key pathway toward energy security and leadership in the burgeoning low-carbon economy. But Canadians will only realize the full benefits of critical mineral development if it is directly connected to a domestic EV manufacturing sector – and this can only happen if domestic EV demand is bolstered through an updated EV availability policy. As EVs are set to make up a quarter of new vehicle sales in 2025 (well over half in China), we look forward to hearing more from government on how it will ensure Canada is a leader, not laggard, in the global transition to electrified transport.“The Iqaluit Nukkiksautiit Project is a transformative hydroelectric project, as renewable energy infrastructure in the North helps address longstanding issues that northern and Indigenous governments have been eager to address for decades: energy security, economic development and prosperity, and diesel reduction. The Inuit-led and -owned project supports electrification, grid modernization, and resilience, presenting an enormous opportunity for local and federal cost-savings, emissions reductions, and job creation. Nunavut is currently almost 100% reliant on diesel fuel for heat and electricity. Investments in the North – thanks to local and Indigenous leaders who have been advocating for clean energy action for decades – are investments in a stronger, more self-sufficient Canada. This is true ambitious nation-building.“On Ksi Lisims LNG, while we respect the Nisg̱a’a Nation’s agency to advance resource projects on their territory, LNG is becoming an increasingly risky economic bet.

  "title": "Trump ‘isn’t serious’ about invading Greenland – but his threat of tariffs is ‘completely wrong’, Starmer blasts",
  "text": "SIR Keir Starmer today claimed Donald Trump was bluffing about a military invasion of Greenland. The PM used an emergency press conference to condemn both the President’s sabre-rattling and trade war threats as “completely wrong”. He hit out after Mr Trump said he had no “obligation to think purely of peace” in his quest to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark. The MAGA strongman also vowed to slap tariffs on allies including Britain that try to stand in his way. But asked if he thought Mr Trump was serious about his threats to take the island by force, Sir Keir said: “I don’t actually. “I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong.” Sir Keir is walking a tightrope between trying to demonstrate strength while maintaining positive relations with the President. European countries have gone further in threatening to retaliate with £80billion worth of tariffs on American exports. Sir Keir said that the President’s threats of tariffs would be completely wrong” but stopped short of pledging to hit back. He added: “The world is markedly more turbulent in recent weeks. Events are moving fast. ANOTHER Tory MP defects to Reform just days after high-profile Jenrick exit Lisa Nandy sparks row after suggesting Farage would be a 'fascist' PM Labour U-turn on plan to exempt spies from proposed Hillsborough Law Starmer rejects calls to cancel King's US visit over Trump tariff threats “And in moments like this, what matters most is being clear about the values and the interests that guide us, even as circumstances change.” By Martina Bet , Political Correspondent Sir Keir Starmer avoided a Love Actually moment this morning. There was no cinematic standoff, no patriotic mic-drop; just a blunt warning Donald Trump’s Greenland tariffs could do “huge damage” to Britain. He knows a Hugh Grant speech might win some cheers, but it will not stop a 25 per cent tariff landing on British exporters in June. Instead, he argued “gesture politics” would simply make working families pay for a trade war they didn’t start. But is refusing to retaliate smart diplomacy or just hoping Trump notices Britain behaving sensibly? While Europe is already sharpening its knives, the PM is gambling on access: the idea that by not marching in lockstep with our neighbours, Britain keeps a whisper of influence in Washington. It’s the same calculation he made over Venezuela, and the same playbook he’s followed ever since Trump returned to the White House. But is that true with an administration that treats loyalty as a transaction and disagreement as disloyalty? The danger is Trump forces that choice anyway and punishes anyone who hesitates.

  "title": "Supporting Price Transparency to Reduce Health Care Costs",
  "text": "In their newly proposed Great Healthcare Plan , the Trump Administration calls for “maximizing price transparency.” This builds on recent efforts from the Administration and Congress to improve price transparency in health care, and has the potential to lower overall health care spending ­­­– particularly in combination with other reforms. Currently, it is difficult and often impossible for consumers to know the price of basic health care services in advance. With clearer pricing information, consumers may choose cheaper services or providers – or may choose to forgo low-value services altogether – which could in turn reduce health care spending and put some downward pressure on health care prices. Transparency is certainly not a panacea for solving health care cost growth, and may turn out to have a limited effect on its own . But more transparency is an important step for facilitating many new cost-cutting reforms , and a first step toward helping consumers play a better role in driving down costs. What Is Being Proposed in Price Transparency? In a summary of their Great Healthcare Plan , the Trump Administration says it would require all providers and insurers who accept Medicare or Medicaid to “prominently post their pricing and fees in their place of business” and to “answer to their patients up front on the prices they will be charged.” The Trump Administration would also require health providers and insurers to comply with price transparency requirements – presumably based on a proposed rule they issued last month. The proposed rule would build up and aim to tackle the shortcomings from a similar 2020 rule , which required hospitals to release data about the prices of items or services in a format that could be analyzed easily. In practice, hospitals failed to submit accurate data; they sometimes reported different rates for the same service, and non-standardized data made comparisons difficult. The proposed rule would improve completeness of the files and comparability of pricing data, while extending the requirement to health insurance plans. Congress has also been considering price transparency efforts of its own. Earlier in the year, a bipartisan group led by Senators John Hickenlooper (D-CO) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act , which would increase the amount of price data that consumers have access to. Both efforts add to numerous efforts over the years to help consumers make cost-conscious decisions about their care. Specifically, the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act would expand reporting requirements to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, imaging services, and ambulatory surgical centers. These are some of the most “shoppable services,” and therefore ones where understanding the price might have the greatest potential to improve competition and impact behavior. Under the bill, providers would be required to disclose a plain language description of the item or service, billing codes, and cost information. Would Greater Transparency Lower Costs? As widespread, comprehensive pricing data has never truly been available, it is unclear how much these efforts might save. Looking to state efforts as a...",

  "title": "Trump Administration Continues Biden-Era Student Debt Cancellation with Latest Pause on Collections",
  "text": "Today, the White House announced an indefinite pause of the collection of defaulted federal student loan debt, including through the Treasury Offset Program, which applies any tax refunds towards a defaulted borrower’s outstanding federal student loan debt. This pausebeganas a temporary pandemic measure under the first Trump Administration and was extended through both bipartisan legislation and Administrative action during the Biden Administration. The current Trump Administrationrestartedthe Treasury Offset Program in May 2025 andappearedon track to be restarting wage garnishment. Today’s announcement reverses these previous decisions by reviving and extending the pandemic era pause. Doing so could lose up to $5 billion per year in collection and lead loan balances to balloon. The following is a statement from Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: Six years out from the COVID pandemic, it’s beyond ridiculous that we’re reviving these emergency policies – and doing so through unilateral executive actions. This is an incoherent political giveaway, doubling down on the debt cancelation from the Biden era. We’re not in a pandemic or financial crisis or deep recession. There’s no justification for emergency action on student debt, and no good reason the for the President to back down on efforts to actually begin collecting debt payments again. Congress enacted historic cost-saving reforms to the federal student loan program this year that put the program on a sustainable path and fair repayment system, and the Trump Administration has been implementing that plan with fiscal costs in mind. Preventing the actual collection of the debt puts that all at risk. Not only will it increase costs to the taxpayer, but it will also actually worsen affordability challenges by allowing student loan burdens to balloon and putting upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. The student loan program isn’t supposed to be a tool to stimulate the economy or buy votes – it’s a way to help millions of students access college. If the Administration wants to reform how we collect on defaulted loans, they should work with Congress on a responsible way to do so. But loans are supposed to be repaid, and the Administration should start collecting. ### For more information, please contact Matt Klucher, Assistant Director for Media Relations, atklucher@crfb.org.

  "title": "White House Releases \"Great Healthcare Plan\" ",
  "text": "Today, the Trump Administration released the Great Healthcare Plan , a legislative framework designed to lower health care costs and address the recently-expired enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies . The plan includes a number of provisions that would lower overall health care costs and generate modest fiscal savings, and one provision – related to the ACA subsidies – that could substantially increase borrowing, depending on its design. By our rough estimates, the cost-reducing provisions could reduce primary deficits by about $50 billion over a decade. The ACA changes could generate modest additional savings or increase primary deficits by up to $350 billion , depending on the design. To lower health care costs, the plan would: Codify Most Favored Nation (MFN) prescription drug price deals: In recent months, the Trump Administration has signed several agreements with pharmaceutical companies where they agree to set certain drug prices at the low price offered in some other countries, generally for Medicaid. The plan calls for Congress to codify these agreements into law. Authorize More Over-the-Counter Drugs: The plan calls for allowing more pharmaceuticals to be available over-the-counter to consumers, rather than requiring a prescription. This proposal would likely reduce premiums and federal subsidies in part by making these drug purchases fully out-of-pocket (insurance does not generally cover over-the-counter drugs) and by reducing doctor’s visits related to getting prescriptions. Additionally, it may reduce drug prices by increasing competition and consumer involvement. Implement Cost-Sharing Reductions for ACA plans: The Trump Great Healthcare Plan calls for funding Cost-Sharing Reductions (CSRs) under the ACA. Funding CSRs would reinstate payments to health insurance companies to cover their cost, ending “ silver loading ” and reducing gross premiums – and as a result premium subsidies – for plans on the ACA exchanges. Reform Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) payments : PBMs are intermediaries that negotiate drug prices with manufacturers and pharmacies. The White House plan says it would “end the kickbacks paid by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to the large brokerage middlemen.” Although details are unclear, PBM reforms could lead to modest savings and cost reductions . Price transparency for insurers and providers : The White House plan would require all providers who accept Medicare or Medicaid and insurers to present clearer pricing information and increase penalties to encourage compliance. Additionally, it would require all insurers to post clearer information, including “plain English” statements on rates and coverage, company profits and claims paid, and tallies of rejected claims, among other things. Providers and insurers would also be required to respond clearly to questions about prices. This additional price transparency could modestly reduce overall health care costs . Taken together, we estimate these changes are likely to save about $50 billion – though the actual savings will depend on details. While most of the provisions would result in modest deficit reduction, the bulk of the savings – $36 billion according to the White House (and consistent with CBO) – would come from funding CSRs. At the same time, the plan’s ACA...",

  "title": "Assessing FY 2026 Appropriations",
  "text": "Without further appropriations, the federal government faces a partialgovernment shutdownon January 30 as the continuing resolution (CR) funding nine of the 12 annual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 expires. With the discretionary spending caps from theFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023now expired, Congress faces few limits on how much to appropriate. Nonetheless, Congress should ensure that any funding package reduces rather than increases the debt by appropriating at responsible levels, avoiding costly add-ons, and capping future discretionary spending levels. In this piece, we explain that: A one-year freeze to discretionary spending could save about $350 billion over a decade. A ten-year freeze would save $1.5 trillion. Congress should reduce total funding to below current spending levels, while passing full-year appropriations for FY 2026. Additional spending increases are particularly unnecessary in light of the $382 billionappropriated bythe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and potential DOGE savings. Any funding bill should focus on appropriations and avoid extraneous spending or tax-cut measures – particularly without offsets. Congress should also renew discretionary spending caps in order to impose limits on appropriations, control spending growth, and reduce projected deficits. Congress Should Appropriate Below Current Levels Congress has not passed all 12 appropriations bills since March 2024 and has largely beenoperating under CRs– which essentially extend past funding – since then. In November 2025, following the longest government shutdown in modern history, Congress enacted three of the 12 appropriations bills – for Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs (MilCon-VA) – and funded the remaining nine bills through a CR in effect through January 30, 2026. Taken together, these bills result in annualized spending of $1.653 trillion for FY 2026 – $10 billion above comparable FY 2025 levels of $1.643 trillion.1 Lawmakers should not allow anotherwasteful government shutdown, nor should they continue to fund the government with stop-gap CRs. But with the deficit projected to total nearly $2 trillion this fiscal year and debt expected to pass 102% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), lawmakers should work to reduce rather than increase total funding levels. Three additional bills that were recently announced by bipartisan, bicameral appropriations leadership (and already passed in the House) – for Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, and Interior-Environment – would reduce spending levels by nearly $4 billion from FY 2025. And an additional two bills announced this week (and passed in the House) – for Financial Services and National Security-State – would further reduce spending levels by nearly $10 billion. On net, this leaves FY 2026 spending levels modestlybelowadjusted FY 2025 nominal levels,2so long as additional appropriations bills are set at or below FY 2025 levels.

Lawmakers should come to an agreement on appropriations that avoids increasing our debt even more, restores the caps on discretionary spending, and maintains flat funding from the last fiscal year.

  "title": "Washington Post Highlights 3% of GDP Deficit Resolution",
  "text": "The Washington Post’s Editorial Board recently published a piece applauding the introduction of a new resolution calling for a 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) budget deficit target , introduced by Bipartisan Fiscal Forum co-chairs Representatives Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Scott Peters (D-CA) alongside Representatives Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) and Mike Quigley (D-IL). They were joined by House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-TX), as well as the rest of the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum steering committee, consisting of Representatives Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), Blake Moore (R-UT), Ed Case (D-HI), Erin Houchin (R-IN), Steve Womack (R-AR), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA), Dusty Johnson (R-SD), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Ron Estes (R-KS), and Jared Golden (D-ME). Noting that the deficit is currently larger as a share of the economy than it was during the Great Depression, the Editorial Board explains that a 3% of GDP deficit goal “is bipartisan recognition that the path the deficit is on undercuts the federal government’s ability to function.” At about the size of the entire U.S. economy, the national debt is on track to exceed its post-World War II record of 106% within the next three years . The 3% target would help to stabilize the debt at around its current level, requiring $7.5 trillion of savings over the next decade to achieve. That is a difficult but realistic goal. The 3% of GDP target has been endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It has also been widely cited around the world and domestically, with the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact recently affirming a 3% target. A 3% deficit-to-GDP target has also received bipartisan support, including from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others in the Trump Administration, as well as from the Obama Administration in the early 2010s, among others . As the Editorial Board writes: While the goal is reasonable, however, the hard truth is that hitting it won’t be easy. Congress will need to look at mandatory spending (mostly Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid), which, along with interest payments, accounts for roughly three-quarters of annual expenditures. Mandatory spending currently takes place on autopilot, outside the annual budget process. Everything needs to be on the table to get the debt under control. Policymakers will need to enact entitlement reforms, spending cuts, revenue increases, trust fund solutions , and health care savings in order to achieve such a goal. They should start by committing to Super PAYGO and enacting $2 of savings for any $1 of new costs. Read the full piece here .

  "title": "WSJ: The Next Class of Senators Won't Be Able to Dodge the Social Security Crunch",
  "text": "In a recentWall Street Journal article, Richard Rubin highlighted an important fact: the Social Security retirement trust fund is projected to become insolvent in late 2032, within the terms of the next class of senators. By law, Social Security can only spend funds out of its revenues and trust fund reserves.Since 2010, its retirement program’s costs have outstripped its dedicated revenues, meaning Social Security has tapped into its trust fund reserves to pay full benefits. Inless than seven years– in late 2032 – the retirement fund’s assets will be exhausted, when today’s 60-year-olds reach their normal retirement age and when today’s youngest retirees approach age 69. Upon trust fund insolvency, all beneficiaries – both current and new – will face a24% across-the-board benefit cut. For a typical couple retiring in 2033, this is the equivalent of$18,400in lost annual benefits. As Rubin writes: The math is brutal for the program known for many years as the third rail of American politics. Social Security owes lifetime benefits to the huge generation of baby boomers who are already retired or almost there. That commitment locks in costs that are virtually impossible to dislodge and puts younger workers and future retirees on course for tax increases, benefit reductions or both. function resizeIframe() {const frame = frame.style.height = frame.contentWindow.} At around the same time, Medicare’s Hospital Insurance trust fundwill also go insolvent, requiring a 12% cut to Medicare hospital payments unless something is done to avoid it. function resizeIframe2() {const frame = frame.style.height = frame.contentWindow.} To prevent sudden cuts to benefits and payments, policymakers, including the next class of senators, will need to enacttrust fund solutionsthat restore balance to Social Security’s and Medicare’s finances and ensure the programs remain solvent for the foreseeable future.Many thoughtful options exist.

The deficit in CY 2025 is $369 billion less than the$2.0 trilliondeficit in CY 2024. CBO estimates that the December 2025 deficit totaled $143 billion – the difference between $627 billion in spending and $484 billion in revenues. Revenue collections of income and payroll taxes were $36 billion more than December 2024 and custom duties were $22 billion more. Corporate income tax revenue was $28 billion less than December 2024. Spending was $86 billion higher in December 2025 than December 2024, but that was largely due to timing shifts where payments were due on weekends; adjusted for timing shifts, outlays were virtually unchanged from December 2024 to December 2025. Total nominal revenue was $5.4 trillion in CY 2025, compared to $4.9 trillion in CY 2024; total nominal spending was $7.0 trillion, compared to $6.9 trillion the same period prior.

  "text": "The United States borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of Fiscal Year (FY) 2026, including $143 billion in December, according to the latestMonthly Budget Reviewfrom the Congressional Budget Office. The following is a statement from Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: As we ring in the new year, it is the perfect time to tackle our growing economic issues and start 2026 on a positive foot. Just three months into FY 2026 and we have already borrowed a total of $601 billion, with $143 billion of borrowing in December alone. Congress’s new year's resolution should be to reverse this trend and reduce our borrowing. As another year begins, we are that much closer to the looming insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds as well – programs that drive spending growth and have been on an unsustainable course for decades. We needtrust fund solutionsthat reduce our borrowing and secure the programs for current and future generations. The endless routine of kicking the can down the road must be left in 2025, or we risk leaving future generations with irreversible economic damage. ### For more information, please contact Matt Klucher, Assistant Director for Media Relations, atklucher@crfb.org.

  "text": "Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday stressed the need to further strengthen public trust in legislative bodies and said the responsibility of making these democratic institutions more credible and accountable to the people rests with presiding officers and elected representatives.Addressing the 86th All India Presiding Officers' Conference here, he said that although innovations such as live telecast and digitisation have helped take legislative proceedings directly to the public, several challenges still remain and need to be addressed.Birla said it is primarily the responsibility of the speakers of state legislatures and public representatives to make legislative assemblies more authentic and people-centric.''We come from different political parties and ideologies, but when we are elected, people expect us to raise in the House their aspirations, challenges and difficulties,'' the Lok Sabha Speaker said.Referring to the two-day conference, Birla said that through discussions and exchange of views, presiding officers would reaffirm their commitment to making democratic institutions more accountable and result-oriented so that issues raised in legislatures lead to positive outcomes.Highlighting the importance of both the ruling party and the opposition, Birla said that while legislative assemblies witness constructive discussions, they also have disagreements.''Consensus and dissent are the strength of our democracy. When all viewpoints are expressed, democratic values are strengthened. This is why dialogue and discussion during this conference are important to enhance public trust in these institutions,'' he said.Birla also noted that several reforms have been introduced in Parliament and state legislatures to enhance public confidence, including the formation of standing committees, live telecast of proceedings, and harmonisation of rules and procedures across states and the Centre.He said after consultations with presiding officers of state legislatures, several changes in the rules have been made while remaining within the constitutional framework.''We can proudly say that through discussion and dialogue, India has demonstrated to the world that parliamentary democracy is the best democratic system,'' Birla added.Emphasising the need for the impartial role of presiding officers in legislative bodies, Birla said, ''We must uphold and implement the finest traditions of our legislatures. As presiding officers of legislative assemblies, our role should be just and unbiased, ensuring that everyone gets the opportunity to express their views.''It is our responsibility to provide time to all members to voice their emotions, as well as speak about the challenges and difficulties of their constituencies.'' He further said, ''Let us emerge from this conference with the resolve that our role will be fair, impartial and uninterrupted. Regardless of which political party we are elected from, once we assume the office of a presiding officer, we must not only appear to be just but also function in a just manner, because the nation is watching us, and so are the people of our states.''

The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland.President Trump's Greenland-related tariff moves endanger the NATO alliance, a Western security alliance that has been in place since the Second World War, Singh said.''This act has raised concerns over potential retaliation from European nations, increasing uncertainty and prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets as tariff-related risks come back into focus,'' Gandhi of HDFC Securities added.

The main idea is to enhance the concept of local community, the coastal community being the Tat Prahari (guardians of the coast),'' the DIG pointed out.The 'CISF Vande Mataram Coastal Cyclothon 2026' will be conducted between January 28 and February 22 as part of the commemoration of 150 years of Vande Mataram.

  "text": "(Updates death toll, adds humanitarian group's quote in paragraphs 4-5) KABUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) -An explosion tore through ‌a hotel in a heavily guarded part of central Kabul on Monday, killing seven people ⁠and injuring several others, authorities in the Afghan capital said.

The ‍district is considered one of the safest in Kabul.Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a ⁠large ‌hole torn ⁠into the front of the hotel building. \"So far, we have received 20 people ‍at our hospital,\" Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCY's Country Director in Afghanistan, said ​in a statement.\"Among the wounded are four women and ⁠a child ...

( TMA/Valeriia Semeniuk ) Update: Helsing schreibt in einem Dementi : „Einem Bloomberg-Artikel vom 19. Januar zufolge zögert die Ukraine mit neuen Helsing-Drohnenbestellungen.

  "title": "Moskau will Angebot prüfen:Trump lädt Putin offenbar zur Teilnahme an sein Gaza-„Friedensrat“ ein",
  "text": "Russlands Staatschef Wladimir Putin ist von US-Präsident Donald Trump in dessen „Friedensrat“ für den Gazastreifen eingeladen worden. Das teilte das Präsidialamt in Moskau am Montag mit. Moskau prüfe den Vorschlag und hoffe auf diesbezügliche Kontakte mit der Regierung in Washington , sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow der russischen Nachrichtenagentur Interfax zufolge. Das Gremium soll den Friedensprozess im Gazastreifen betreuen . Russland unterhält Kontakte sowohl zu Israel als auch zur Palästinenser-Führung und zur Terrororganisation Hamas. In Moskau stieß die Einladung in das von US-Präsident Donald Trump geplante Gremium auch deshalb auf Wohlwollen, weil Russland sich traditionell als wichtiger Akteur im Nahen Osten sieht und dort eigene geopolitische Interessen verfolgt. Zudem sieht sich Kremlchef Putin damit, ungeachtet seines Angriffskriegs gegen die Ukraine, willkommen auf internationaler Bühne. Derzeit prüfen wir alle Details des Angebots. Zudem hoffen wir auf Kontakte mit der amerikanischen Seite, um alle Nuancen zu klären. Dmitri Peskow , Kremlsprecher Deutschland lässt Teilnahme an Trumps „Friedensrat“ offen Die US-Regierung hatte auch Deutschland dazu eingeladen, Teil des „Friedensrates“ für den Gazastreifen zu werden. Die Bundesregierung werde in Absprache mit ihren Partnern darüber beraten, wie sie mit dieser Einladung umgehe, sagte Regierungssprecher Stefan Kornelius am Montag in Berlin. Eine Zusage für die Teilnahme Deutschlands gab er noch nicht ab. Regierungssprecher Kornelius wollte sich nicht festlegen in der Frage, ob eine Zusammenarbeit mit Putin in einem solchen Gremium für die Bundesregierung überhaupt denkbar sei. Auf eine entsprechende Frage sagte Kornelius: „Wir werden uns abstimmen darüber, welchen Weg wir am besten gehen, um unser Kerninteresse zu verfolgen – nämlich, den Frieden in Gaza dauerhaft zu erreichen.“ Die Bundesregierung bedanke sich für die Einladung. Auch Großbritannien ist bereit, eine Rolle in der zweiten Phase des Waffenstillstands in Gaza zu spielen, wie Premierminister Keir Starmer am Montag auf einer Pressekonferenz sagte. Sein Land sei mit seinen Verbündeten über die Bedingungen im Gespräch, erklärte Starmer. Trump hat insgesamt rund 60 Staats- und Regierungschefs zur Teilnahme eingeladen. Trumps „Friedensrat“: Wer wurde noch eingeladen? Einladungen für den „Friedensrat“ erhielten etwa auch der türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Ägyptens Staatschef Abdel Fattah al-Sisi und Argentiniens Präsident Javier Milei. Letzterer bezeichnete seine Ernennung als „Ehre“. Auch der kanadische Premierminister Mark Carney will nach Angaben von einem seiner Berater die Einladung annehmen. Ungarns Ministerpräsident Viktor Orbán soll ebenfalls eine Einladung erhalten haben, die er bereits angenommen habe. Zahlreiche weitere Regierungen bestätigten am Wochenende den Erhalt des Briefes, der auch die Zahlung von einer Milliarde Dollar für eine mehr als dreijährige Mitgliedschaft vorsieht . Das internationale Gremium soll die neue Übergangsregierung des im Krieg zwischen der Hamas und Israel weitgehend zerstörten Küstenstreifens beaufsichtigen. Trump selbst hat den Vorsitz. Am Freitag berief der US-Präsident unter anderem seinen Außenminister Marco Rubio, seinen Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner, den US-Sondergesandten Steve Witkoff sowie den früheren britischen Premierminister Tony Blair zu Gründungsmitgliedern des Gremiums.

  "title": "„Eine Art Trump-Vereinte-Nationen“:USA laden Regierungschefs zu international „Friedensrat“ ein",
  "text": "Im neu geschaffenen „Friedensrat“ von US-Präsident Donald Trump können sich Staaten unbefristet einen Sitz sichern, wenn sie innerhalb eines Jahres eine Milliarde US-Dollar zum Etat beisteuern. Dies geht aus dem Entwurf der Charta hervor, über den mehrere Medien berichteten und dessen vollständigen Text die „ Times of Israel “ veröffentlichte. Verwaltet würde das Geld laut eines Berichts von „ Bloomberg “ von Trump persönlich, der zugleich als Vorsitzender des Friedensrates agieren soll. Es solle vor allem für den Wiederaufbau Gazas genutzt werden. Aus den 13 Kapiteln geht zudem hervor, dass die US-Regierung das Mandat des Rats stark erweitern möchte – über den bisherigen Fokus auf die Befriedung und den Wiederaufbau des Gazastreifens hinaus. Der Rat soll sich demnach mit einer „Koalition der Willigen“ um Krisen und Konflikte rund um den Globus kümmern. Es handelt sich um eine Art ‚Trump-Vereinte-Nationen‘, die die Grundprinzipien der UN-Charta ignoriert. EU-Diplomat Kritiker sprechen daher schon von einer möglichen Konkurrenz zu den Vereinten Nationen , die Trump immer wieder als dysfunktional kritisiert. Diese Kritik klingt auch in der Präambel an. Dort heißt es, dauerhafter Frieden erfordere „pragmatisches Urteilsvermögen, vernünftige Lösungen und den Mut, von Ansätzen und Institutionen abzuweichen, die allzu oft gescheitert sind“. Ziel sei ein „agileres und effektiveres“ internationales Gremium zur Friedensförderung. Auch Putin soll eingeladen worden sein Dem bisherigen Konzept zufolge soll sich der Rat auf den Gaza-Konflikt konzentrieren. Das Gremium gehört zur zweiten Phase von Trumps Friedensplan für den Gazastreifen, die ein dauerhaftes Kriegsende und die Entwaffnung der Terrororganisation Hamas vorsieht, was diese ablehnt. Das Gremium soll die neue Übergangsregierung des Küstenstreifens beaufsichtigen.

  "title": "Söder indirekt als „Hurensohn“ beleidigt:Das Probl der Grünen mit ihrer Parteijugend ist zurück",
  "text": "Eigentlich wollen Katharina Dröge und Britta Haßelmann am Montagmorgen im Bundestag über Grönland sprechen. Auch die Sicherung der kritischen Infrastruktur nach der linksextremen Attacke auf das Berliner Stromnetz wollen die beiden Fraktionschefinnen der Grünen bei ihrer Jahresauftaktsklausur thematisieren. Doch bei den Nachfragen der Presse müssen sich die beiden dann mal wieder für die Parteijugend rechtfertigen. Der Vorsitzende der Grünen Jugend, Luis Bobga, steht seit Tagen in der Kritik, weil er in einem Instagram-Video den bayerischen Ministerpräsidenten Markus Söder (CSU) indirekt als „Hurensohn“ bezeichnet hat. In dem Video hatte der 23-Jährige zu Musik des Künstlers Haftbefehl mitgerappt. Als das Wort „Hurensohn“ fiel, wurde ein Bild von Söder eingeblendet. Aus der CSU folgten prompt Rücktrittsforderungen, und auch aus den eigenen Reihen hagelte es Kritik. Bobga selbst äußerte sich bereits am Samstag und erklärte, es sei nicht sein Ziel gewesen, Söder mit dieser Beleidigung direkt anzusprechen, und es täte ihm leid. Eigentlich wolle er auf Social Media junge Menschen erreichen und ihr Interesse an Politik wecken. Wir fanden die Entschuldigung richtig. Katharina Dröge, Fraktionsvorsitzende der Grünen im Bundestag, begrüßt die Entschuldigung von Bobga. „Wir fanden die Entschuldigung richtig“, sagte Dröge am Montag im Bundestag knapp und war dabei sichtlich bemüht, das Thema nicht noch größer zu machen. Doch hinter den Kulissen ist das Entsetzen bei den Grünen groß. Dort fühlt man sich an die regelmäßigen Entgleisungen und Skandale von Bobgas Vorgängerin, Jette Nietzard, erinnert. Die stand zwar nur ein Jahr an der Spitze der Grünen Jugend, war dabei jedoch immer wieder aufgefallen. Eine unvollständige Übersicht : Bei TikTok bezeichnete sie Söder als „Hundesohn“, im Bundestag trug sie einen Pullover mit der Abkürzung „ACAB“ („All Cops are Bastards“), und auf X schrieb sie an Silvester, dass Männer, die beim Böllern ihre Hand verlieren würden, „zumindest keine Frauen mehr schlagen“ könnten. Entfremdung zwischen Partei und Parteijugend Die ständigen Provokationen und Entgleisungen hatten das Verhältnis zwischen Partei und Parteijugend massiv belastet. Zwar war es dem unabhängigen Jugendverband mit seinen knapp 20.000 Mitgliedern zuletzt immer weniger gelungen, inhaltlich Einfluss auf den Kurs der Grünen zu nehmen. Doch das öffentliche Bild der Partei wurde von Nietzard stark mitgeprägt. Dass Nietzard nicht für eine zweite Amtszeit kandidierte, sorgte im vergangenen Jahr dann auch für Erleichterung in der Parteispitze. Mit der Wahl von Bobga und Henriette Held zur neuen Doppelspitze verbanden viele in der Partei die Hoffnung auf einen Neuanfang. Henriette Held und Luis Bobga sind die neuen Chefs der Grünen Jugend. © dpa/Sebastian Willnow Doch nun musste Parteichef Felix Banaszak, Vertreter des linken Parteiflügels, auch mit Bobga über seinen Social-Media-Auftritt sprechen. In der Parteizentrale war man von dem Video überrascht worden. Von einem ungewollten Ausrutscher ist die Rede. Zwar gilt Bobga dort als der Co-Sprecher, der Jette Nietzard inhaltlich nahe steht, aber stilistisch hatte sich der neue Bundesvorstand eigentlich von deren Methoden absetzen wollen. „Ich definiere mich nicht in Abhängigkeit zu Jette“, sagte Bobga etwa im vergangenen Jahr dem Tagesspiegel . Das ist eine Wortwahl, die in jeglicher Hinsicht scharf abzulehnen ist. Marlene Schönberger , Grünen-Bundestagsabgeordnete aus Bayern Tatsächlich...",

  "title": "Wird Grönland zum Streitfall in der Koalition?",
  "text": "Es ist ja nicht so, als wäre Jens Spahn unumstritten. Das ist er weder in der Unionsfraktion, der er vorsteht, noch in der Koalition mit der SPD. Aber das scheint ihn nicht anzufechten. Auch das nicht, was daraus folgen könnte, nicht. Seine jüngsten Äußerungen zu Donald Trump sprechen dafür. Unvergessen sind die desaströse Richter-Nachwahl zum Bundesverfassungsgericht und der Rentenstreit . Schlechte Koordination in der Fraktionsspitze war bald noch das Geringste, was Spahn vorgehalten wurde. Nebenbei wurde in dem Zuge mal wieder seine Loyalität zu Friedrich Merz bezweifelt. Stephan-Andreas Casdorff ist Editor-at-Large des Tagesspiegels. Er fragt sich, wie lange das zwischen Friedrich Merz und Jens Spahn noch gut geht. Und dann jetzt das Interview mit der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“. Das klingt, als wolle er sich inhaltlich vom Kanzler und CDU-Chef abgrenzen. Spahn zeigte Verständnis für das Vorgehen der USA gegen Grönland, nicht ganz so deutlich, aber doch vernehmlich. Das erinnert an Spahns Nähe zu Trump-Gefolgsleuten, etwa zum früheren US-Botschafter Richard Grenell. Es erinnert gegenwärtig besonders seine Gegner daran. Von denen hat er einige. Stephan-Andreas Casdorff Betrachte man die Lage Grönlands auf dem Globus, findet Spahn, seien die „von den USA gestellten Fragen nachvollziehbar“. Trump habe „einen Punkt“, wenn es darum gehe, „ob wir als Nato und Europa diese strategisch immer wichtiger werdende Insel ausreichend gegen andere Mächte wie Russland schützen“. Worte wie Donnerhall. Denn so, wie er es sagt, fehlte die rechte Distanz zu dem, was Trump treibt und die Europäer mächtig umtreibt. Das erinnert an Spahns Nähe zu Trump-Gefolgsleuten, etwa zum früheren US-Botschafter Richard Grenell. Es erinnert gegenwärtig besonders seine Gegner daran. Von denen hat er einige. Daher kommen auch die Gerüchte, dass Merz und er schon einige Male aneinandergeraten seien. Kann es das eine Mal zu viel gewesen sein? Im Mai steht die Wahl des Fraktionsvorsitzenden an. Ob es Spahns Wiederwahl wird? Noch wird alles dementiert, was das infrage stellt. Aber niemand kann bestreiten, dass die Gedanken manch Wichtiger in der Union darum kreisen, ob weniger Umstrittene in Spitzenpositionen nicht doch mehr Ruhe und Gemeinsamkeit in die Koalition bringen. Nötig hätte sie’s.",

  "text": "衰えていく末期がんの母の体力を目の当たりにすると、頭でわかっていても、不安で気持ちが揺れる。積極的な治療をせず自宅で過ごすと決めた母の意思を尊重すると決めたコラムニストの石原壮一郎さんが、命と向き合った家族の記録を綴る。気持ちを伝えられるうちに「聞いた方がいい」と、意を決して尋ねたことに、毅然と答えた母だったが･･･。“そのとき”を意識する日々がとうとう訪れた。 母が体重やお通じを記載していたカレンダーと、その隣に長いあいだ貼られている「長寿手ぬぐい」。83歳だった母は、毎朝どんな気持ちでこれを眺めていたのだろうか（写真提供／石原壮一郎、以下同） 執筆／石原壮一郎 1963(昭和38)年三重県生まれ。コラムニスト。1993年『大人養成講座』（扶桑社）がデビュー作にしてベストセラーに。以来、「大人」をキーワードに理想のコミュニケーションのあり方を追求し続けている。『大人力検定』（文藝春秋）、『父親力検定』（岩崎書店）、『夫婦力検定』（実業之日本社）、『失礼な一言』（新潮新書）、『昭和人間のトリセツ』（日経プレミアシリーズ）、『大人のための“名言ケア”』（創元社）など著書は100冊以上。故郷を応援する「伊勢うどん大使」「松阪市ブランド大使」も務める。 　＊　＊　＊ 聞くなら今しかない「残酷な質問」 　その話題を切り出したのは、5月下旬、3度目の腹水穿刺（お腹に針を刺して腹水を抜く処置）をしてもらった日の午後だった。この頃、母の体力は目に見えて衰えていた。 　聞いていいものだろうか。これまで貫いてきた「石原昭子の生き方」をまっとうしてもらうには、聞いておいたほうがいいだろう。聞くなら、寝たきりになる前の今しかない。いつものようにテレビで再放送の時代劇を見ながら昼食を食べたあと、こう尋ねた。 「あのさあ、まだまだやと思うから聞くけど、どんな葬式をしてほしい？」 　あまりにも不躾で、残酷な質問である。母は少し驚いた様子ではあったが、いつもの穏やかな口調でしっかり答えてくれた。 「そやなあ、父ちゃんのときみたいに派手なんはいらんかな。本当に来たいって思ってくれる人だけ、来てくれたらええわ。コロナがあってから隣組の人らの香典も手伝いもなしになったけど、連絡はしてもろたほうがええかな」 　15年前に亡くなった父親の葬儀は、当時としては「普通のやり方」だったが、コロナ後の今から見ると、それなりに大がかりで参列してくれる人も多かった。親戚や隣組や近所の人たちに、たくさん手伝ってもらったのも覚えている。 　予想通りの答えだったが、本人の言葉で希望のイメージを聞けてよかった。母としても話しておくことができて、きっとよかったに違いない、と信じたい。どの家が「隣組」なのかも聞いておくことができた。地域の付き合いを大切にしてきた母としては、「何かあったとき」の連絡先を息子に伝えたことで、ホッとできただろうか。 上は、高校の卒業式の日。下はそれから65年後に、母のお見舞いに来てくれたときのもの。前列向かって右が母、前列左のいくちゃんと後列左のえっちゃん、そして写真上で合流してもらった後列右のあきちゃん（埼玉在住）の4人は、上の写真と同じ位置で並んでいる。後列中央は、小中学校時代からの友人であるふさちゃん。誰もがそれぞれ多くの苦労を乗り越えてきたことだろう。65年後にこうして顔を合わせて笑い合えている写真を撮れてよかった 　重くなりかけた雰囲気を吹き飛ばそうと、明るい口調で「こういうことは、なかなか本人の希望を聞くことはないもんな」と言うと、母は「そやな。珍しいやろな」と笑った。やっぱり強い人である。ただ、そのあと少しうつむいて「ほんでもまあ、とうとう葬式の話になったか」と寂しそうに呟いた。その声の響きは、今も耳に残っている。 最後になった母の新聞投稿 　母が退院してからも、寝るときは母屋とは別棟の2階に引っ込んでいた。しかし、だんだん離れて寝るのが心配な状態になってくる。介護用ベッドを使い始めた5月上旬から、ベッドが置いてある和室で隣りに布団を敷いて寝るようになった。 　無意識のうちに緊張していたのだろうか。12時頃に寝ても、朝3時か4時頃には目が覚めてしまう。私が起きたときには、ベッドの上の母も目を開けていた。「おはよう」と言うと「おはよう」と返ってくる。当たり前のやり取りができることが、とても嬉しい。旅立つ日まで40～50日あったこの頃は、母の「おはよう」も力強かった。 　いつの間に書いて送ったのか、5月26日付の「夕刊三重」に母の投稿が掲載された。「最後の投稿」である。タイトルは「息子夫婦が大病の私を／いたわってくれ幸せ」。そこには「嫁が一緒にお風呂に入ってくれ」たことや「夜は息子と枕を並べて」寝ていることが綴られていた。「こんな日が一日でも長く続きますように願うばかりです」とも。 「夕刊三重」2025年5月26日付より。感謝を伝えられている側としては、ひじょうに面映ゆい。母は投稿が掲載されると、定規を当てて周囲をマーカーで囲んでいた。このときは力が十分に入らなかったようで、いつもは真っすぐな線が微妙に曲がっている 　新聞が配達された直後、投稿コーナーを見た私が「あれ、この『女性、80代』って？」と言ったときに、目くばせして小さく首を振っていた母の表情が忘れられない。いたずらがバレた子どものようだった。感謝を直接伝えるのはテレ臭かったのだろう。バレないわけはない“いたずら”だが、あっさり見破ってちょっと申し訳なかった。 母が起きられなくなった日 　朝、起き出して台所でお茶を淹れていると、洗面所から「ピッ」と体重計の電子音が聞こえてくる。母は退院してから毎朝、体重を測ってトイレのカレンダーに書き込んでいた。お通じの回数も「正」の字で記録してある。母がいなくなってからも、そのカレンダーを片付ける気にはなれず、去年の暮れまで5月のまま壁にかけっぱなしだった。 トイレに掛けられていたカレンダー。まだ立つことができた28日と29日も、体重が書き込まれていない。お通じも1週間以上なかったようだ。ベッドから起きられなくなったのは、医療用麻薬の増量が直接の原因ではなく、そういう“時期”だったのだろう 　まだ外が暗い早朝に、母とのんびりとお茶をすする。母が頼りにしていた甥っ子のカツキさんが、山あいで丹精込めて栽培したお茶だ。この年の春もたくさんの新茶を届けてくれた。母は「やっぱり、カツキのお茶がいちばんおいしいわ」と満足そうにお茶を飲みながら、昔の楽しかった思い出をポツリポツリと話す。 　お正月になるとみんなですき焼きを囲んだこと、子どもや孫とあちこち旅行に行ったこと、子どもの頃に父親にくっついて山仕事に行ったこと……。時おり亡くなった夫の愚痴になることもあったが、今となってはノロケの一種に聞こえる。相づちを打ちながら、母が投稿に書いたように、私も「こんな日が一日でも長く……」と願っていた。 沖縄、北海道、箱根、鎌倉、東北、浅草や柴又……。父親が元気だった頃も、いなくなってからも、いろんなところに出かけた。写真は2007年夏に沖縄に行ったとき。妻が「お義母さんの水着も持ってきたからね」と言うと、最初はしり込みしていたが、やがて覚悟を決めて着てくれた。生まれて初めての水着＆海水浴だったらしい。このとき母は65歳、父は70歳。気が付くと、自分も妻も当時の母の年齢に近づいている 　母がベッドから起きられなくなったのは、私が外せない用があって東京の自宅に戻っていた5月29日の夜だった。実家に残って母を看てくれていた妻から、夜中に「お義母さんが急に弱って、コップも持てなくて落としてしまった」という連絡が入る。水もほとんど飲もうとしないという。かなりあわてている様子だ。 　その日の朝、私が出発する前には、台所のテーブルで自分でご飯を食べてしっかり話もしていた。いきなりの展開に驚いたが、どうしようもない。焦りは意外になかった。「石原昭子は息子がいないタイミングで旅立つような人ではない」と信じていたのかもしれない。都合がいい希望的観測だが、幸いなことに買いかぶりではなかった。 　翌朝、妻から「少し落ち着いた様子で、お粥も食べてくれた。梅を漬けようという話をしたら元気になった」という連絡があった。その後、看護師さんが酸素を供給するチューブを鼻につないでくれたり、ケアマネさんがヘルパーさんのシフトを増やす調整をしてくれたりなど、ベッドの上で過ごす環境を整えてくれたようだ。 母は毎年、近所の家で梅の実をもらってきて、たくさん梅干を漬けていた。春ごろから「今年は漬けられやんかな」と寂しそうに言っていたが、教えてもらうことはできる。起きられなくなった直後、まだ青い実だったが、妻と孫と初めての梅干作りにチャレンジした。妻が桶の中を見せながら「こんな感じ？」と尋ねると、その時だけは大きく目を見開いて、はっきりした言葉で「うん、大丈夫」と答えてくれた。出来上がったときには母はいなかったが、れっきとした「共作」だ。ちょっとしょっぱめで、オツな味である 　私が東京から戻って「ただいま」と声をかけると、少し起こしたベッドで首をちょっとこちらに向けて、小さな声で「おかえり」と返してくれた。昨日の朝に比べて、表情が乏しく顔色もよくない。ともあれ、また会えて何よりである。このときは調子が良くなればまた起きられるかと思っていたが、母の足の裏が畳を踏むことは二度となかった。 　ひと月ほど前から、痛みを抑えるために医療用麻薬の貼り薬が処方されていた。どこまで関連があるかはわからないが、体が動かなくなってベッドから起きられなくなったのは、主治医の判断で貼り薬の容量が倍になった日の深夜だった。ガンの激しい痛みで苦しまないためには、意識を朦朧とさせる必要があるのだろう。 　弱ってきた母に、強い薬が必要になっていくのは仕方がない。それは十分にわかっている。しかし、事前に「薬を変えたら起きられなくなるかもしれない」と言っておいてほしかったと、チラッと思ってしまった。とはいえ、もし聞いていたらどうしただろう。 　母に「起きられるうちに、しておきたいことはある？」と尋ねるのは、かえって酷だ。増量された薬がどんな影響を及ぼすかを知った上で貼るのは、言ってみれば自分の手で母をベッドに縛り付けることになるわけで、心理的な負担が極めて大きい。そう考えると、薬で深刻な変化が起きる可能性を伝えても、本人や家族を苦しめるだけである。 　主治医の先生はそういったことも考慮しつつ、具体的な見通しを伝えることのメリットとデメリットを天秤にかけて、伝えない選択肢を選んだのだろう。先生は一貫して、母はもちろん家族の気持ちにも親身に寄り添い、治療のことや家族に何ができるかなどをいつも丁寧に伝えてくれた。お世辞ではなく、母も家族も「この先生でよかった」と心から感謝している。 　それでも、身内が余命わずかという「非日常」の渦中にある家族は、過剰にナーバスになって「些細なこと」に引っ掛かりを感じがちだ。引っ掛かりが心の中で大きく育ってしまうと、抱かなくていい不信感や怒りにつながる。せっかく理想的な先生やクリニックに出会えたのに、そんな気持ちを抱くのはもったいない。 　訪問診療や訪問介護の現場では、家族との感情的な対立が起きがちだと聞く。要望や疑問は遠慮なく伝えたほうがいいが、不安を原動力に重箱の隅をつついて不信感や怒りを抱いたところで、全員にとって百害あって一利なしである。自分も妻も「過剰にナーバスになってしまう罠」にうっかり絡めとられなくて、本当によかった。 つづく。 ←Vol.6を読む →連載「147日目に死んだ母――がん告知から自宅で看取るまでの幸せな日々」を最初から読む",

  "text": "女優のジェニファー・ローレンス（dpa/時事通信フォト） 写真一覧 「ほぼネイキッド！」……そんな言葉が、現地時間1月11日にロサンゼルスで開催された「ゴールデン・グローブ賞」授賞式の夜、瞬く間に飛び交った。レッドカーペットに現れた女優のジェニファー・ローレンス（35）は、バストとヒップがかろうじて見えない姿で登場。遠目には、ほぼヌードにも見えるほどの大胆なデザインで、会場のみならずSNSでも一気に注目をさらった。 ジェニファーが身にまとっていたのはジバンシィのドレス。透け感のあるメッシュ地をベースに、淡いピンク色の花々がなめらかな体のラインに沿って咲くよう刺繍されている。着用したジェニファーの姿は上品で、むしろ幻想的な雰囲気すら漂っていた。 この日の授賞式では、クラシックなイブニングドレスに身を包んだ女優が大多数を占めていたため、ジェニファーの装いはひときわ異彩を放った。「攻めすぎている」「さすがに裸同然は驚く」「もはや芸術だ」「女神の降臨！」といったさまざまな声が飛び交い、SNSは騒然。長らく“親しみやすいアメリカン・スイートハート”として愛されてきただけに、その大胆な姿は、より強いインパクトを与えたようだ。",

  "text": "Latest Updates Gender & Conflict My Reading List Online Event 29 January 2026 10am Port-au-Prince | 4pm Brussels Please register here if you would like to attend this online event. (An kreyòl Ayisyen anba a) Two years ago, Haiti’s most powerful gangs created a united front called Viv Ansanm to battle the authorities together. By joining forces, the criminal alliance has achieved a level of military might far beyond anything previously seen in the country. Viv Ansanm has rapidly extended its territorial reach, expanded its illicit rackets and pushed the country to a fresh peak of violence. As a new international force readies for deployment, gangs increasingly claim they are fighting to defend the poorest from predatory elites, and seeking to be granted full amnesty. In this online event, our Haiti expert, Diego Da Rin, will present the results of our most recent report “ Undoing Haiti’s Deadly Gang Alliance ”, followed by a discussion with Haitian anthropologist Isabelle Clérié and National Human Rights Defence Network’s Program Director Rosy Auguste Ducéna. Panellists will offer insights into the reconfiguration of Haitian gangs and how to address the challenges they pose to Haiti’s stability. Panellists: Diego Da Rin | Crisis Group Analyst, Haiti Isabelle Clérié | Executive Director, Haiti Impact Group Rosy Auguste Ducéna | Program Director, National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH) Moderator: Renata Segura | Program Director, Latin America and Caribbean The panel discussion will be held in English and Haitian Creole with simultaneous interpretation. A recording in English will be available afterwards on YouTube , Haitian Creole will be available only via Zoom. Jedi, 29 janvye 10 a.m. Pòtoprens | 4 p.m. Briksèl Tanpri enskri la si w ta renmen patisipe nan evènman anliy sa a. Sa fè de (2) lane depi gang ki pi pisan Ayiti yo te mete tèt yo ansanm anba non Viv Ansanm pou batay kont otorite yo, ansanm. Apre yo te mete fòs yo ansanm, alyans kriminèl la te reyalize yon nivo fòs militè ki depase tout sa nou te janm wè nan peyi a. Viv ansanm kontinye pran kontwòl nouvo teritwa, yo ogmante aktivite ilegal yo, epi yo pwovoke yon nouvèl vag vyolans nan peyi a. Pandan yon nouvo fòs entènasyonal ap pare pou l deplwaye nan peyi a, gang yo pa sispann di y ap goumen pou defann moun ki pi pòv yo kont elit k ap peze souse yo epi y ap mande pou akòde yo amnisti konplè. Nan evènman anliy sa a, ekspè sou Ayiti nou, Diego Da Rin, pral prezante rezilta dènye rapò nou ki gen pou tit “ Demantle Kowalisyon Kriminèl Gang yo an Ayiti ”.

  "text": "▲ 전국시·도자치경찰위원장협의회 연구용역 결과 보고 및 토론회가 16일 서울에서 열렸다. 전남자치경찰위원회 제공 현행 자치경찰제의 한계를 극복하고 주민 체감형 치안 서비스를 실현하기 위해 전국 시·도 자치경찰위원장들이 지혜를 모았다. 전국시·도자치경찰위원장협의회는 “지난 16일 서울에서 ‘자치경찰제 실질화 연구용역 결과 보고 및 토론회’를 열어 ‘완전한 자치경찰제’ 전환 방향과 공동 대응 방안을 논의했다”고 19일 밝혔다. 이번 토론회는 국가경찰 체제 내에서 사무만 분리되어 운영되는 현행 제도의 구조적 한계를 짚어보고, 조직과 인력이 완전히 분리되는 ‘이원화 모델’로의 전환 방안을 논의하기 위해 마련됐다. 참석자들은 2021년 도입된 현행 자치경찰제가 국가경찰 체제에서 사무만 분리·운영되는 구조적 한계로 주민이 체감하는 맞춤형 치안 서비스 제공에 어려움이 있다는 데 의견을 모았다. 이에 따라 향후 구성될 범정부 협의체 논의 과정에서 현장 의견이 충분히 반영된 제도 설계가 필요하다는 점에도 공감했다. 첫 발제자인 황문규 중부대 경찰행정학과 교수는 단순한 권한 강화가 아닌 조직·인력이 함께 이관되는 ‘완전한 자치경찰제(이원화 모델)’ 전환 필요성과 법제화 방안을 제시했다. 또, 김홍환 한국지방세연구원 박사는 독립적 재정 기반 마련이 필수라며 소방안전교부세와 유사한 안정적 재원 구조 도입, 자치경찰 교부세 신설 등 재정 모델을 제안했다. 토론회에 참석한 시·도 자치경찰위원장들은 “범정부 협의체 논의 과정에 공동 대응하자”고 뜻을 모았다. 정부는 올해 시범운영 지역을 선정한 뒤 결과를 토대로 2028년 이원화 자치경찰제를 전면 시행할 계획이다. 협의회는 연구용역 결과를 바탕으로 시·도 경찰청을 광역지방자치단체로 이관하는 ‘완전한 자치경찰제’ 도입을 위한 단일 건의안을 채택하고, 현장 중심의 제도 설계가 반영되도록 대응할 방침이다. 정순관 회장은 “지역 치안은 종합적 특성이 있어 사무 구분에 따른 이원화는 현장 혼란을 초래할 수 있다는 우려에 공감한다”며 “사무 구분이 아닌 조직 분할적 접근이 대안이 될 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “범정부 협의체와 시범운영 과정에 적극 참여하겠다”고 말했다. 이세훈 기자 #자치경찰 #전국시도자치경찰위원장협 #이원화 #토론회 #범정부",

  "title": "김병기, 제명 일주일 만에 탈당…여론 악화에 '백기'",
  "text": "공천헌금 수수 등 각종 비위 의혹을 받고 있는 김병기 더불어민주당 의원이 19일 오전 국회 소통관 기자회견장에서 탈당 기자회견을 마친 뒤 인사하고 있다. ⓒ데일리안 홍금표 기자 공천헌금 수수 등 각종 의혹에 대한 당 안팎의 거센 비판에도 버티기에 돌입했던 김병기 더불어민주당 의원이 돌연 당 윤리심판원의 제명 처분을 수용한 데 이어 탈당까지 선언하면서 그 배경에 관심이 쏠리고 있다. 본인과 당을 둘러싼 여론이 갈수록 악화하자 결단을 내린 것이라는 분석이 나온다. 최근 공천헌금 수수를 비롯한 13가지 의혹으로 경찰 수사를 받고 있는 김병기 의원은 19일 오전 10시 기자회견 열어 윤리심판원의 제명 처분을 수용하겠다고 밝혔다. 그는 \"윤리심판원의 결정문을 통보받지 못했지만 재심을 신청하지 않고 (당을) 떠나겠다\"고 말했다. 김 의원은 윤리심판원이 제명 처분을 내리자 즉각 재심 청구를 하겠다며 불복 의사를 밝혔는데 일주일 만에 태도를 바꾼 것이다. 김 의원은 이날 기자회견에서 탈당에는 여전히 선을 그었으나, 이날 오후 1시 35분께 중앙당 사무총장실에 탈당계를 제출했다. 약 3시간 만에 기존 입장을 번복한 것이다. 그는 오후에 낸 입장문에서 \"정들었던 민주당을 떠나기로 결정했다\"며 \"제기된 모든 의혹에 대해 성실하고 당당한 자세로 임하겠다. 반드시 진실을 온전히 밝히겠다\"고 했다. 김 의원은 오전 회견에서 최고위원회의 의결을 통한 최종 제명 처분을 요구했으나, 실정법상 불가능하다는 것을 알게 되자 탈당을 선택했다는 게 지도부의 설명이다. 정당법 제33조에 따르면 국회의원 제명을 위해서는 최고위원회의의 의결과 의원총회의 추인을 거쳐야하며, 의총에서 당 소속 의원들의 2분의 1 이상의 찬성이 필요하다. 김 의원의 요구는 의원총회에서 발생할 수 있는 불필요한 당내 갈등을 최소화하려는 취지였다는 해석이 나온다. 김 의원의 결단은 그간의 버티기 전략이 역효과를 키우고 있다는 판단에서 비롯됐다는 분석이 지배적이다. 당 안팎의 비난이 거세진 데다, 장동혁 국민의힘 대표가 단식 투쟁에 돌입하며 공천헌금 특검을 요구하는 등 의혹이 특검 이슈로까지 번지고 있기 때문이다. 박상병 정치평론가는 \"두 가지 요인이 복합적으로 작용했다\"며 \"재심을 신청해 무죄를 주장하더라도 결과가 달라지기 어렵다는 점을 확인한 것이 결정적이었을 것\"이라고 말했다. 그는 또 \"당 안팎의 비판이 과도한 상황에서 특검 가능성까지 거론되자 최악의 상황을 피하기 위해 더는 버틸 수 없다고 판단한 것\"이라고 분석했다. 실제로 공천헌금 수수 의혹이 확산되면서 이재명 대통령과 민주당 지지율은 동반 하락했다. 한국갤럽이 지난 13∼15일 무선 100% 전화면접 방식으로 조사한 결과, 이 대통령의 국정 지지율은 지난주(60%)보다 2%p 하락한 58%로 집계됐다. 당 지지율도 직전 조사보다 4%p 빠진 41%를 기록했다. 자세한 내용은 중앙선거여론조사심의위원회 홈페이지를 참조하면 된다. 김 의원의 탈당으로 제명을 위한 최고위원회의와 의원총회는 열리지 않게 됐다. 윤리심판원은 탈당계 제출 직후 회의를 열어 김 의원의 징계 처리 방안을 논의했다. 조승래 사무총장은 \"'징계 중 탈당'이라고 기록하는 게 적절하다고 이해하는데, 윤리심판원이 어떻게 판단할지는 지켜봐야겠다\"고 말했다. 김 의원이 경찰 수사에서 무혐의 처분을 받을 경우 당은 구제 절차를 밟을 가능성이 있다. 조 사무총장은 \"당의 일원으로 돌아올만한 사유가 발생하면 당연히 회복 조치를 할 것\"이라며 \"비상 징계든 일반 징계든 구제 절차를 다 갖추고 있다\"고 밝혔다.",

  "title": "금·은, 연일 최고치…그린란드 갈등에 안전자산 쏠림",
  "text": "도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령의 그린란드 병합 구상으로 미국·유럽 간 '대서양 동맹'에 균열 우려가 커지는 가운데 국제 금과 은 가격이 연이어 사상 최고치를 경신하고 있다. 영토 문제를 둘러싼 갈등에 더해 미·유럽연합(EU)간 무역전쟁으로까지 확전되는 양상을 보이면서 글로벌 금융시장에서 위험 회피 심리가 급속히 확산되고, 투자자들이 금과 은 등 안전자산으로 자금을 이동시키는 모습이다. AFP연합뉴스 19일(현지시간) 2월물 금 선물 가격은 전일 대비 1.71% 상승한 온스당 4674.2달러를 기록 중이다. 지난주 사상 최고치를 돌파한 데 이어 다시 한 번 역대 최고가를 새로 썼다. 현물 금 가격 역시 1.6% 오른 온스당 4668.14달러에 거래되고 있다. 은 가격도 금과 함께 가파른 상승세를 보이는 중이다. 3월물 미국 은 선물은 장중 한때 온스당 93.035달러까지 오르며 사상 최고치를 기록했다. 이후에도 5% 이상 상승한 93.02달러 선에서 거래되고 있다. 현물 은 가격 역시 3.55% 오른 온스당 93.16달러를 나타내는 중이다. 이번 귀금속 가격 급등의 직접적인 촉매는 트럼프 대통령의 그린란드 병합 야욕으로 촉발된 지정학적 불확실성 확대다. 트럼프 대통령은 그린란드를 \"완전하고 전면적으로 매입\"하는 합의가 이뤄질 때까지 유럽 8개국의 수입품에 관세를 부과하겠다고 발표했다. 이에 따라 덴마크, 노르웨이, 스웨덴, 프랑스, 독일, 영국, 네덜란드, 핀란드 등 8개국을 대상으로 다음 달 1일부터 10%, 오는 6월 1일부터는 25% 대미 관세를 부과하겠다는 방침을 밝혔다. 유럽연합(EU) 역시 맞대응을 예고했다. EU는 회원국을 경제적으로 위협하는 제3국에 대해 서비스, 외국인직접투자(FDI), 금융시장, 공공조달, 지식재산권 분야의 거래를 제한할 수 있는 통상위협대응조치(ACI) 발동을 고려하고 있다. 이 조치는 강력한 대응 수단이란 점에서 '무역 바주카포'로도 불린다. 북극권 영토 편입을 둘러싼 논란이 국제 정치·경제의 뇌관으로 부상한 셈이다. 최근 미국의 베네수엘라 공습 및 정권 개입과 이란을 둘러싼 군사적 긴장 가능성도 안전자산 선호를 자극하는 요인으로 지목된다. 미국은 지난 3일 니콜라스 마두로 베네수엘라 대통령을 체포하고 해당 국가의 석유 산업에 대한 통제권을 확보했다. 트럼프 대통령은 또 이란 내 반정부 시위와 국내 혼란을 이유로 군사 행동 가능성을 시사했다가 최근 들어 다소 수위를 낮춘 바 있다. 이처럼 지정학적 리스크가 복합적으로 얽혀 있는 상황이 당분간 이어질 가능성이 높은 만큼, 금과 은을 비롯한 안전자산 강세 흐름도 쉽게 꺾이지 않을 것으로 보인다. 조지 체블리 나인티 원 천연자원 포트폴리오 매니저는 2026년 부문별 전망 보고서에서 \"금의 상승 랠리는 강력할뿐 아니라 여전히 견고한 펀더멘털에 기반하고 있다\"며 \"실질금리 하락 가능성과 중앙은행의 외환보유고 다변화 추세를 고려할 때, 금 가격은 급락보다는 현재 수준을 유지하거나 추가 상승할 가능성이 높다\"고 분석했다. 뉴욕=권해영 특파원 roguehy@asiae.co.kr",

  "text": "━ 2026 동계올림픽 D-17 앞선 두 번의 동계올림픽에서 은메달 2개를 목에 건 스피드스케이팅 장거리 간판 정재원은 세 번째 도전에서 금메달을 반드시 거머쥔다는 각오다. 주 종목인 매스스타트에 전념하며 금빛 질주를 준비 중이다. [연합뉴스] “‘킹메이커(왕을 만드는 자)’도 좋지만, 이번엔 ‘킹(왕)’이 되고 싶습니다.” 다음 달 밀라노·코르티나담페초 올림픽을 앞둔 한국 스피드 스케이팅 장거리 간판 정재원(강원도청)의 야심만만한 바람이다. 8년 전, 17세 고2였던 그는 2018 평창 올림픽 매스스타트에서 13살 많은 대선배 이승훈의 금메달을 도왔다. 앞장서서 레이스를 이끌며 다른 나라 경쟁자들의 힘을 빼는 페이스 메이커 역할을 맡았다. 당시 “어린 선수를 희생양 삼았다”는 비판도 있었지만, 정재원은 “팀 플레이일 뿐”이라며 묵묵히 받아들였다. 팀 추월에선 이승훈과 은메달을 합작한 그는 소년 같은 귀여운 이미지로 ‘뽀시래기’라 불렸다. 평창올림픽 매스스타트 우승 직후 함께 달린 정재원(왼쪽)의 손을 들어주는 이승훈. [연합뉴스] 21세에 나선 2022 베이징 올림픽 매스스타트에선 은메달을 추가했다. 그는 “올림픽 메달은 하늘이 내려주는 거다. 2등은 해봤지만, 정상을 향한 갈망이 있다”고 솔직하게 말했다. 정재원은 2025~26시즌 국제빙상경기연맹 월드컵 1~4차 대회에서 은메달 2개를 목에 걸었다. 3번째 올림픽에서도 포디움(메달권)에 오를 확률이 꽤 높다. 이번 올림픽엔 매스스타트 한 종목에만 집중한다. 매스스타트는 ‘스피드 스케이팅 경기장에서 진행하는 쇼트트랙’ 정도로 설명할 수 있다. 16명 선수가 집단으로 출발해 트랙 16바퀴를 레인 구분 없이 달려 순위를 가린다. 바퀴 수마다 배점이 다르지만, 마지막 결승선을 가장 먼저 통과하면 가장 높은 60점을 한꺼번에 받는다. 마지막 2~3바퀴를 남기고 막판 스퍼트와 코너링이 중요하다. 정재원은 “코너링에 도움이 될 수 있어 쇼트트랙 훈련을 주2회 병행했다”고 했다. 충북 진천선수촌에서 동료들과 쇼트트랙 경기장에서 겨루면 정재원이 거의 일등으로 들어왔다. 정재원은 “강원도 양양에서 팀 동료들(박지우 등)과 사이클을 하루에 4~5시간씩 탔다. 체력 훈련량도 늘렸다. 김준호(빙속 500m 국가대표) 형과 커피를 자주 마시며 훈련법을 공유했다”고 했다. 2022 베이징 올림픽 남자 매스스타트 결승에서 이승훈과 정재원이 질주하고 있다. 중앙포토 올림픽 매스스타트 경쟁자로는 마흔 살에도 여전히 정상급 기량을 유지 중인 요릿 베르흐스마(네덜란드)를 비롯해 개최국 이탈리아의 안드레아 조반니니, 단거리 뿐 아니라 중·장거리도 톱클래스 경쟁력을 갖춘 조던 스톨츠(미국) 등이 있다. 매스스타트는 한해 한해 경기 속도가 빨라져 막판 스퍼트 때 파워와 스피드, 체력 모두 좋아야 한다. 2~3바퀴가 남았을 때 치고 나가는 타이밍도 잘 잡아야 한다. 친분이 있거나 같은 나라 선수들끼리 암묵적으로 ‘팀 스케이팅’을 타는 경우가 많아서 정재원에 상대적으로 불리할 수 있다. 정재원은 지난해 11월 캐나다 캘거리 월드컵 2차 대회 당시 마지막 바퀴를 알리는 종이 칠 때 11위로 처져 있었다. 하지만 인코스를 파고들어 마지막엔 2위로 결승선을 통과했다. 당시 상황에 대해 “올림픽 대비 시뮬레이션이었다”고 설명한 그는 “자리 싸움이 치열하고 장비가 부딪힐 수 있어 뒤쪽에 최대한 머물다 치고 나갔다. 이 작전이 성공하면 올림픽 때 어떤 상황이 오더라도 당황하지 않을 거라 판단했다”고 했다. 4년 전 베이징 올림픽에서 너무 뒤처져 있다가 0.07초 차이로 금메달을 놓친 그는 “당시엔 변수에 빠르게 대처하는 경험이 떨어졌다. 지금도 어리지만, 2차례 올림픽을 통해 성장했고 노하우도 생겼다”고 했다. 2001년생 정재원은 올림픽에 3번째 나서는데도 만 24세다. 대선배 이승훈은 올림픽에 4번 출전해 메달 6개를을 땄다. 정재원은 “4년 뒤 2030 알프스 올림픽 때도 난 28세다. 그땐 지금보다 더 높은 수준으로 발전해 또 올림픽에 나설 자신이 있다”고 했다. 이어 “올림픽 준비 때문에 2년 전 결혼한 아내와 신혼여행도 못 갔다”면서 “밀라노 관중석의 아내에게 손 키스를 날리고, 메달을 목에 걸어주고 싶다”고 각오를 다졌다. 박린 기자",

  "text": "자료 제출로 공방…국힘 \"지금은 속개 어려워\" 인사청문결과보고서 채택 시한, 오는 21일까지 이혜훈 기획예산처 장관 후보자 인사청문회가 19일 자료 제출을 둘러싼 여야 공방으로 열리지 못하고 파행됐다. 국회에서 인사청문회 대기실로 향하는 이 후보자. /남윤호 기자 [더팩트ㅣ국회=정채영 기자] 19일 이혜훈 기획예산처 장관 후보자의 인사청문회가 끝내 열리지 못하고 파행했다. 국민의힘이 자료 미제출을 이유로 안건 상정을 거부하면서다. 국회 재정경제위원회는 이날 국회에서 전체회의를 열었으나 여야의 공방 끝에 이 후보자에 대한 인사청문회를 진행하지 못한 채 정회했다. 박성훈 국민의힘 수석대변인은 이날 오후 국회에서 기자들과 만나 \"현재까지도 이 후보자에 대한 충분한 자료 제출이 되지 않았다\"고 설명했다. 그는 \"현재까지도 들어오지 않았고, 오늘 들어온다고 하더라도 분석하고 질의 자료를 만들기까지 최소 이틀은 필요하다는 것이 국민의힘 입장\"이라고 밝혔다. 그는 '내일(20일)은 열릴 가능성이 있는지' 묻는 말에 \"여야 간사 간 논의되고 있지만 지금으로서는 (진행이) 어렵다\"고 답했다. 재경위는 이날 오전 국회에서 전체회의를 열고 이 후보자의 인사청문회를 진행하려고 했으나 국민의힘 소속 임이자 위원장이 안건 상정을 거부하면서 이 후보자의 출석 없이 회의만 진행했다. 민주당은 후보자 없이 인사청문회를 진행한 전례는 없다며 반발했으나 국민의힘은 이 후보자의 자료 제출이 부족해 청문회 진행이 어렵다고 맞서면서 회의장은 고성이 오가기도 했다. 약 1시간 동안의 회의 끝에 임 위원장은 양당 간사에게 인사청문회 진행 일정을 변경해야 하는지 합의해달라며 정회를 선포했다. 임 위원장은 \"위원장 생각은 반드시 (인사청문회를) 개최해야 한다는 것\"이라며 \"두 간사가 협의해서 오면 회의를 속개하는 걸로 하겠다\"고 말했다. 그러나 정회 후 재경위는 회의를 재개하지 않았다. 국민의힘이 이 후보자가 요청 자료의 15%만 제출했다고 주장한 것과 관련해 이 후보자는 \"과장\"이라고 반박했다. 사진은 19일 오전 서울 여의도 국회에서 재정경제기획위원회 전체회의가 열린 가운데 이혜훈 기획예산처 장관 후보자의 좌석이 비어있있는 모습. /배정한 기자 앞서 이 후보자는 이날 오후 국회에서 기자들과 만나 \"국민들께 소명할 수 있는 기회를 갖기를 기다리고 있다\"며 \"확보할 수 있는 자료는 다 제출했다\"고 말했다. 국민의힘이 이 후보자가 요청 자료의 15%만 제출했다는 주장에 대해서는 \"과장\"이라며 \"75% 정도 냈다\"고 반박했다. 그는 이어 \"이미 자료 보존 기간이 지나 심지어 30~40년 전 거를 달라고 하시니 못 내는 것들이 많다\"며 \"더 낼 수 있는 자료를 찾아서 일요일 오후 3시에 다 제출했다\"고 강조했다. 인사청문회법상 이 후보자의 인사청문결과보고서 채택 시한은 오는 21일까지다. 이에 따라 인사청문회는 늦어도 20일에는 진행돼야 한다. 하지만 국민의힘의 반대로 청문회 일정이 불투명해지면서 시한 내 개최 여부도 불확실한 상황이다. 지난달 28일 이재명 정부 초대 기획예산처 장관으로 지명된 이 후보자는 지명 이후 갑질 의혹 등 각종 논란에 휩싸였다. 국민의힘 중·성동을 위원장 재임시절 같은 지역 시구의원들을 상대로 \"내가 찍은 사람만 공천을 주겠다\"며 엄포를 놨다는 공천 갑질 의혹 등이 대표적이다. 여기에 지난 2017년 바른정당 소속 국회의원이던 시절 자신과 관련된 언론 기사를 보고하지 않은 인턴 직원에게 폭언하는 내용이 담긴 녹음 파일이 공개되면서 파문이 번졌다. 이 밖에도 배우자로부터 증여받은 아파트에 대한 증여세 미납 여부, 세 아들이 미성년자 시절 부모를 통해 거액의 증여세를 납부했다는 '부모 찬스 의혹' 등을 받는다. 이 후보자는 제기된 의혹들에 대해 청문회에서 소명하겠다는 입장을 고수하고 있다. chaezero@tf.co.kr 발로 뛰는 더팩트는 24시간 여러분의 제보를 기다립니다. ▶카카오톡: '더팩트제보' 검색 ▶이메일: jebo@tf.co.kr ▶뉴스 홈페이지:",

'공천뇌물 특검 수용' ' 무도한 여당 야당 탄압 중단' '통일교 게이트 특검 수용' 손팻말을 든 의원들 옆으로는 50여명에 가까운 지지자들이 같은 팻말을 들고 함께 구호를 제창했다. 국민의힘은 이러한 강경 투쟁 방식이 보수 지지층을 결집시키는 효과를 냈다고 보고 있다. 박성훈 수석대변인은 이날 국회에서 기자들과 만나 \"그동안 야당답게 싸우지 못하는 점을 지적하는 지지자들이 있었는데, 장 대표가 나서서 목숨 건 단식을 함으로써 보수층 결집을 이끌어내고 있다\"고 설명했다. 실제 국민의힘 지지율 반등으로 이어졌다. 지난달 15∼16일 전국 18세 이상 1004명을 대상으로 한 정당 지지도 조사에서 민주당은 5.3%p 하락해 42.5%, 국민의힘은 3.5%p 상승한 37.0%로 집계됐다. 양당 격차가 한 자릿수로 줄어들면서 지난해 9월 이후 4개월 만에 오차범위 안으로 좁혀졌다. 한동훈 전 대표가 당원게시판 사태에 대해 공식 사과하면서 새로운 국면을 맞이했다. 사진은 장동혁 국민의힘 대표와 의원들이 19일 오후 서울 여의도 국회 로텐더홀에서 열린 통일교 게이트·더불어민주당 공천뇌물 특검 촉구 규탄대회에서 구호를 외치고 있는 모습. /남용희 기자 하지만 지지율 상승과 별개로 당내는 여전히 폭풍전야다. 한동훈 전 대표가 당원게시판 사태에 대해 공식 사과하면서 새로운 국면을 맞이했기 때문이다. 비록 한 전 대표가 당 중앙윤리위원회의 제명 결정을 '정치 보복'이라 규정하며 날을 세우긴 했지만 '사과'라는 선제 조치를 취함으로써 징계 철회 혹은 수위 조절의 명분을 쌓았다는 평가다. 실제 이날 최고위원회의에서도 이를 둘러싼 당 지도부간 이견이 그대로 노출됐다. 양향자 최고위원은 \"장 대표가 단식하는 의도를 있는 그대로 받아주고, 한 전 대표가 사과하는 진심을 그대로 믿어줄 수 없는가. 당 지도자들과 리더들부터 단결하는 모습을 보여주자\"고 촉구했다. 반면 조광한 최고위원은 한 전 대표의 사과를 겨냥해 \"진정성 없는 말장난\"이라며 \"영악한 머리를 앞세워 교언영색, 교묘한 말과 꾸민 얼굴빛으로 더 이상 세상을 속여서는 안 된다\"고 비판했다. 그러면서 당내 시선은 자연스럽게 '한 전 대표 징계 수위'로 쏠리고 있다. 대여 투쟁을 위해 결집해야 할 기운이 당 내부 갈등에 빨려 들어가는 '반감 효과'가 나타나고 있는 것이다. 한 영남권 의원은 에 \"'강성이 뭉치면 중도층은 따라오게 돼 있다'는 건 말이 안 된다\"며 \"국민 여론과 맞지 않는 논리를 펼치면 극단으로 가게 돼 있다. 그 결과는 항상 좋지 않다\"고 지적했다. '이제 다시 장 대표 선택의 시간'이라는 게 친한계 입장이다. 한 친한계 의원은 와의 통화에서 당 일각에서 거론된 '한 전 대표의 장 대표 단식농성장 방문'에 대해 \"한 전 대표 본인뿐만 아니라 친한계 의원 대부분 전혀 생각 없다\"며 \"우리는 공을 장 대표에게 넘겼다. 의미...",

  "text": "김병기 더불어민주당 의원이 19일 서울 여의도 국회 소통관에서 당 윤리심판원의 제명 결정에 대한 입장을 밝히는 기자회견을 하고 있다. /뉴스1 더불어민주당 윤리심판원은 19일 자진 탈당한 김병기 의원에 대해 사실상 사후 제명 처분을 내렸다. 정계에 따르면 민주당 윤리심판원은 김 의원에 대해 제명에 해당하는 징계 사실을 확인하는 조치를 취했다. 당규상 윤리심판원은 탈당한 자에 대해서도 징계 사유가 존재한다는 사실을 확인하는 결정을 할 수 있다. 윤리심판원의 김 의원 징계 사실 확인 결정은 사실상의 사후 제명 조치인 셈이다. 향후 당원자격심사위원회는 김 의원의 복당을 심사할 경우 심판원의 결정 취지를 반영해 심사한다. 김 의원은 공천 헌금 수수 의혹과 배우자의 구의회 법인카드 사적 유용 의혹 등을 받아왔다. 그는 지난 12일 심판원에서 제명 처분을 받았으며, 이날 재심 신청 포기 의사를 밝힌 뒤 탈당계를 제출했다. 이번 조치는 지난 1일 강선우 의원 탈당 이후 처분과 같다. 민주당은 앞서 주식 차명 거래 의혹으로 탈당한 이춘석 의원에 대해서도 같은 조치를 취했다. - Copyright ⓒ 조선비즈 & Chosun.com -",

  "text": "지난 18일(현지시간) 시리아 동부 라카의 정부군 병력 [AFP 연합뉴스 재판매 및 DB 금지] (이스탄불=연합뉴스) 김동호 특파원 = 튀르키예 분리주의 무장조직 쿠르드노동자당(PKK)의 공격으로 시리아 정부군 3명이 숨지고 여럿이 다쳤다고 시리아 국영 SANA통신이 19일(현지시간) 보도했다. 이번 충돌은 전날 아메드 알샤라 시리아 임시대통령이 또다른 쿠르드족 무장조직 시리아민주군(SDF)의 수장 마즐룸 압디와 휴전과 병력 통합에 합의한 지 하루 만에 벌어졌다. 시리아 정부군은 \"PKK와 옛 정권 잔당 등 일부 테러단체가 정부군을 공격해 합의 이행을 방해하려고 한다\"고 비판했다. 시리아 국방부는 또 시리아 북동부 하사카주(州)의 알샤다디 마을에 PKK가 설치한 급조폭발물(IED)이 민간 차량 근처에서 폭발하면서 여러 명이 다쳤다고 전했다. SDF는 극단주의 테러조직 이슬람국가(IS) 대원 수천명이 수감된 하사카 지역의 샤다디교도소가 정부 측 무장단체의 공격을 받아 교전이 벌어졌다고 밝혔다고 로이터통신이 전했다. SDF는 이 교도소를 방어하는 과정에서 수십명이 죽거나 다쳤다고 주장했다. 이 교도소는 시리아 내전 기간 미국의 지원을 받아 IS 소탕전에 참여한 SDF가 통제했지만 전날 휴전 합의로 정부군에 인수될 예정이다. 이날 시리아 정부군은 SDF가 통치권을 넘기기로 한 데이르에조르, 하사카, 라카 등 북동부 3개 주 일대에 병력을 배치하기 시작했다. 알자지라방송은 수일 내로 알샤라 대통령이 압디를 만날 예정이라고 보도했다. 이번 휴전 합의로 시리아 임시정부가 자치 분권을 외쳐온 SDF에 대해 우위를 점하게 됐다는 해석이 나왔다. SDF는 작년 3월 정부군으로 흡수·통합되는 방안에 동의하고도 이를 이행하지 않고 버텨왔다. 일각에서는 인접국 튀르키예가 PKK 진압을 명분으로 조만간 시리아에 군사개입할 것이라는 전망이 나온다. PKK는 미국과 유럽연합(EU), 튀르키예 등에서 테러단체로 지정돼 있다. 지난 수년간 시리아, 이라크 등 국경지대에서 PKK와 쿠르드민병대(YPG) 등을 상대로 강도 높은 군사작전을 벌여온 튀르키예는 SDF가 PKK, YPG와 연계됐다고 본다. 2024년 12월 이슬람 반군 하야트타흐리르알샴(HTS)은 바샤르 알아사드 정권을 무너뜨리고 임시정부를 세우는 과정에 친튀르키예 세력의 도움을 받았다. dk@yna.co.kr ▶제보는 카톡 okjebo",

But the flames spread rapidly, leaping through a structure that housed 1,200 stores in Karachi's historic centre. \"It engulfed the whole mall in front of our eyes,\" shopowner Shahbaz Iqbal, 27, told Reuters on Monday, after the blaze was largely extinguished following a 24-hour firefight. Authorities said more than 60 people were still missing and 21 have been killed. \"We thought it was a small fire. No one ever thought it would be this bad.\" Iqbal and his co-workers ran upstairs and out of the mall from one of the basement exits, but those coming from the upper floors weren't as lucky. With the facility due to close soon, most of the mall's gates were locked. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters that all but three of the mall's 16 exits were locked. \"When I went in (to the building), I saw the locks,\" said rescue worker Aqeel, who declined to share his whole name as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Gul Plaza's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. 'All my people' As rescue workers dug through mounds of debris, human remains were pulled out of the building in white cotton sheets turned into makeshift sacks. Shafi Ahmed, who owned a store in the basement, stood holding his hands together in prayer. When asked if anyone he knew was inside, he said five of his friends were left in the mall. \"These are all our people. These are all my people. These are our people,\" he said, breaking down in tears. Police struggled to hold back grieving families and shopowners who said they had lost everything. At one point, officials discovered a drawer full of money, causing a fight to break out among shopowners claiming it was theirs. Rising anger Hundreds of protesters gathered around the smouldering remains of the building on Monday calling for accountability from the authorities. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has promised an investigation into the fire and response time, while Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers from the angry crowd. Roads still under construction outside Gul Plaza were inundated with water after the firefight. Rescue officials sat in a tent outside the building, noting down the names of the missing. Razia, 40, who goes by one name, said six of her relatives worked in the building. \"One of them jumped out with two of his friends. One of the friends broke his legs and the other died on the spot,\" she said, describing the account from the relative, her nephew. Another of her family members, a flower shop worker named Ibrar, did not make it out. He broke down a door to...",

  "title": "Curlee Discaya felt ‘robbed’ when asked to return money to gov’t",
  "text": "Embattled contractor Pacifico \"Curlee\" Discaya II on Monday said he feels being “robbed” when asked to restitute or return money to the government in order to qualify under the Department of Justice's Witness Protection Program (WPP). Discaya said this amid a heated exchange between Senator Rodante Marcoleta and Prosecutor General Richard Fadullon on the topic of restitution or the return of ill-gotten wealth by a person applying for the WPP. During Monday’s hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, Marcoleta asked Discaya what the DOJ told him before he and his wife Sarah could be entered into the WPP. “Your Honor, kung magkano po ang ire-restitute po muna namin… Ako po, hindi ko po masabi kung magkano po kasi para sa akin po, parang kami po ang nanakawan,” Discaya answered. (Your Honor, we discussed how much we should restitute first… I couldn’t give an amount because for me, it's like we were the ones who were robbed.) “Parang ibig sabihin, parang modern day na pagnanakaw. Ibig sabihin, ‘yung nakaw ba, siya pa magbibigay ng pera doon sa ninakawan niya? Parang gano’n po,” he added. (It seems like modern day robbery. Does it mean the thief should give money to the person who was robbed? It feels like that.) Previously, the Discaya couple were considered “protected witnesses” under the WPP. However, both eventually stopped cooperating with the Justice Dept. Fadullon said the Discayas dropped names of personalities who were allegedly connected to anomalous flood control projects, but these were not supported by additional evidence. The Prosecutor General, during the hearing, dismissed as “lies” the claim of Curlee Discaya that they were immediately asked by the DOJ to return ill-gotten wealth. “Ang pinag uusapan po dito, bago man lang makapagsabi ng ganon, kailan munang makita kung ano ang gusto at kayang sabihin at patunayan ni Mr. Disacaya at ni Mrs. Discaya doon sa kanilang salaysay… Pero hindi po sila nakikipag-ugnayan sa department kaya hindi po sila mabigyan ng kaukulang proteksyon at hindi po ma-process ang kanilang application,” Fadullon explained. (What we were talking about here is, before they were asked to restitute, we have to see first what Mr. Disacaya and Mrs. Discaya are willing to prove in their narrative... But they are not communicating with the department so they cannot be given appropriate protection and their application cannot be processed.) Marcoleta has repeatedly questioned the DOJ for insisting that the Discayas should return illegally acquired wealth, if any, to the state coffers before they can be entered into the WPP. Sarah Discaya was arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on December 18 after a court issued a warrant against her for corruption and malversation of funds charges in connection with the P96.5-million ghost flood control project in Davao Occidental. Curlee, on the other hand, is currently detained at the Senate after being cited in contempt by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee during a hearing on anomalous flood control projects on September 18. — RF, GMA Integrated News",

  "title": "Ombudsman: R ulla tackled high-impact, long-pending cases in first 100 days",
  "text": "The Office of the Ombudsman intensified its prosecutorial efforts in high-impact and long unresolved cases during the first 100 days of Jesus Crispin Remulla's leadership, the agency said Monday. “As he marks his first 100 days in office, Ombudsman Remulla, Seventh Ombudsman of the Republic of the Philippines, reaffirmed the Office of the Ombudsman's unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and the swift and impartial administration of justice. The Office has intensified case build-up, investigation, and prosecution efforts, particularly for long-pending and high-impact cases,” the office said in a statement. “Close coordination with law enforcement agencies has been strengthened, allowing prosecutors to engage from the earliest stages of investigation to ensure strong, constitutionally sound cases. In line with public concern, the Ombudsman has prioritized the investigation of flood control projects nationwide, resulting in the filing of graft and malversation charges in connection with substandard and ghost projects in several provinces,” it added. Within Remulla’s first 100 days, Ombudsman prosecutors filed three batches of criminal cases related to the anomalous flood control projects: the malversation and graft charges filed vs. former Ako Bicol party-list congressman Zaldy Co and 16 others with the Sandiganabayan over the P289 million substandard road dike project in Oriental Mindoro; the malversation and graft charges filed against contractor Sarah Discaya and others at the Digos City, Davao del Sur Regional Trial Court (later transferred to Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu) over the P96.5-million ghost flood control project in Davao Occidental; and the malversation and graft charges filed vs. former senator Ramon Bong Revilla, Jr. and six others with the Sandiganbayan over the alleged P92.8-million ghost project in Pandi, Bulacan. Likewise, the Ombudsman said that the Resident Ombudsman Program has been revived to bring accountability closer to the ground through immediate fact-finding and faster action in agencies identified as high-risk for corruption. The Environmental Ombudsman Program, on the other hand, has also been re-established to target corruption linked to environmental violations and holding both public officials and private individuals accountable when acting in conspiracy. As for institutional reforms, the Ombudsman’s office cited that the implementation of the Revised Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman to reduce delays, clarify processes, and strengthen due process, including firm timelines for fact finding investigations, as well as Ombudsman Remulla issuing Memorandum Circular No. 3, Series of 2025 removing the requirement of consent of the public official in the disclosure of the Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALNs), provided that it is based on a meritorious request. Moreover, the Ombudsman said that a strategic planning conference, the first in over a decade, is set for February 2026. \"These first 100 days set the tone. The work will continue to be decisive, impartial, and anchored on the people’s trust,” Remulla said. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

  "text": "Last week, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) launched the “Digital Bayanihan Chain,” making the Philippines the first country in the world to put its national budget on blockchain beginning with the P6.793-trillion 2026 General Appropriations Act (GAA). Blockchain is defined as an immutable or unchangeable and tamper-proof digital ledger or record of all transactions within a network. DICT Secretary Henry Aguda said that with the national budget now on blockchain, “every peso of Filipino taxpayers’ money is recorded in a permanent and tamper-resistant digital ledger.” Aguda, moreover, said that blockchaining the budget would mean reduced corruption with a tamper-proof system which makes fraudulent manipulations nearly impossible; clear tracking of public funds with citizens, media, and watchdogs can trace the flow of funds from approval to spending; evidence across administrations, meaning that records remain intact even when governments change; and stronger public trust, resulting from confidence in the government growing “when the truth is verifiable.” While the government touted the initiative as an anti-corruption, transparency, and public accessibility effort, tech experts expressed their reservations as they “debunked” misconceptions about blockchain. EXPLAINER: What is blockchain and how is it expected to stop corruption? Traxion Tech/Traxion Pay Inc. founder and CEO Ann Cuisia clarified that blockchain, while being campaigned as a transparency tool, “what is often being described is the archiving or tokenization of PDF documents, sometimes by placing they were solving a fundamental economic flaw. Between cryptography, P2P networking, and game theory, the goal wasn't just ‘security’ —it was sovereignty. It was about creating a system where math, not a government money printer, dictates value. They didn't build this to block hackers. They built this to opt out of a broken system,” said Rabadon. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

  "text": "The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has issued a show cause order (SCO) against a tricycle driver who went viral for executing a counterflow maneuver and even taunting other motorists. In a statement, the LTO said it also imposed a 90-day preventive suspension on the driver’s license of the tricycle driver. “Ang paggawa ng counterflow at pag-uugali na walang disiplina at respeto sa kalsada ay hindi lamang labag sa batas kung di pati na rin isang pagbabalewala sa kaligtasan ng lahat. Hindi tayo papayag na magkaroon ng mga driver na itinuturing na biro ang mga batas trapiko at nang-aasar pa sa ibang mga gumagamit ng kalsada,” said LTO chief and Transportation Assistant Secretary Markus Lacanilao. (Executing counterflows, undisciplined behavior, and lack of respect for others on the street is not just against the law, it is also a disregard for everyone’s safety. We will not let these kinds of drivers who treat traffic laws as a joke and even taunt other road users.) “Ang LTO ay determinadong pigilan ang ganitong uri ng pag-uugali – bawat isa sa ating kalsada ay may karapatan sa ligtas at maayos na daanan,” he added. (The LTO is determined to put an end to these kinds of attitudes – everyone on the road has the right to a safe and orderly street.) The LTO’s issuance of the SCO and preventive suspension stemmed from a viral dashcam video of a motorist, which showed the tricycle driver executing a counterflow, a violation of traffic regulations. The tricycle driver was seen on video taunting the motorist who recorded the dashcam video. In the SCO, the LTO compelled the owner and the driver of the tricycle to present themselves before the LTO’s Intelligence and Investigation Division (IID) on January 22 at 10 a.m. “Kailangan nilang magsumite ng verified explanation kung bakit hindi sila dapat patawan ng administribong kaso tulad ng reckless driving, obstruction of traffic, driving against traffic, duty to have a license, compulsory registration of motor vehicles at kung bakit hindi dapat suspendihin ang lisensya ng driver sa pagiging improper person to operate a motor vehicle,” the LTO said. (They should submit a verified explanation why they should not face administrative cases such as reckless driving, obstruction of traffic, driving against traffic, duty to have a license, compulsory registration of motor vehicles. And why the driver’s license should not be suspended for being an improper person to operate a motor vehicle.) The driver’s license of the tricycle driver was placed under a 90-day preventive suspension while the tricycle was placed under an LTO alarm while the investigation is ongoing. The LTO warned that it will resolve the case based on the evidence at hand if the respondents fail to attend the hearing or submit a verified explanation. — JMA, GMA Integrated News",

Nothing matches the frustration of sitting at a red light when no one is coming the other way.City staff are working to change that.  A pilot program is underway using AI to improve signal timing and safety.“We believe leveraging technology will help us better understand and react to traffic issues,” says IT Manager Jim Alberque.“We are turning real-time video from traffic cameras into data,” Alberque explains.Jed Niffenegger, Transportation Manager, points out that traditionally this has been a manual and time-consuming process. Staff would stand at intersections with clipboards inputting traffic counts.“In theory with this pilot project, we can have data at our fingertips to optimize traffic signals,” Niffenegger says. “We like to say, ‘real-time, all the time’.”PilotThe City has more than 200 traffic cameras throughout Raleigh.During the pilot phase of the program, the AI system can analyze data from about a dozen cameras. The City doesn’t store the video or collect identifying information.Potential“If we can perfect and scale the pilot, we can provide our timing engineers with real-time accurate data so they can improve signal timing,” Niffenegger points out. “This can result in a monumental amount of cost savings in both time saved and fuel savings.”For example, a corridor such as Capital Boulevard carries 60,000 vehicles per day.  A 1-percent improvement in timing for a two-mile section with six signals could save tens of thousands of dollars per day.Alberque and Niffenegger emphasize this could be very beneficial to a growing city like Raleigh. As traffic increases, the answer isn’t always to widen a road. Many corridors still have plenty of capacity.Often, the problem with moving traffic is the intersections. This will help maximize what we have.As the program and technology are fine-tuned, it will likely be used in other cities across the country.As for that red light frustration? This AI technology could lead to less gridlock and safer intersections. Share Twitter Facebook Email Print",

  "text": "From presidential kidnappings in Venezuela to possible regime toppling in Iran to high-profile defections in Westminster, the new year has brought with it an exceedingly busy news cycle. One thing that is still in the news is, unfortunately, a continuation of a scandal of the previous few years: Britain’s continued spending on perks for illegal immigrants. Migrant Help, a charity centred around providing financial support and advice for asylum seekers, has signed a £385 million deal with the Home Office. They continue to provide financial aid to migrants, “whether the decision [on asylum status] has been positive or negative.” The charity has developed an app called ‘Just Good Work’ which allows asylum seekers to find jobs prior to any asylum decision being made. While the Home Office does allow migrants who have been waiting for an asylum decision for over 12 months to apply for work, there are obvious questions that should be asked about both Migrant Help as a charity and this app. Namely, if asylum is granted for those fleeing war or persecution, why do both market Britain as a place to earn a higher salary? The app creates an obvious pull-factor and makes job seeking a lot easier for those that have arrived in our country illegally. The government can put out statement after statement and have Shabana Mahmood give weekly speeches on wanting to clamp down on illegal immigration but it all rings so hollow when the Home Office is making the lives of these illegal immigrants so much easier. To make matters even worse, we uncovered yesterday a scheme that pays illegal migrants… even after they have been removed from the country. A new £1.8 million scheme will see those returning to Algeria or Sri Lanka be given aid as part of the Home Office Returns Reintegration Programme. Labeled as ‘reintegration support’, the Home Office is seeking a partner to help deliver a whole host of perks for those returning to those countries including: Airport reception provision for Returning Individuals Temporary accommodation for up to 5 nights following arrival Transportation to an onward destination in-country So the Home Office will give illegal immigrants VIP airport treatment, a nice hotel stay and then pay for travel, even once they are back in their own country. To make matters even worse, as part of the Returnee Education and Entrepreneurship fund (REEF), some of this money will even go towards funding training, further education and business start-ups for deported illegal immigrants once back in their home country. All of this speaks to what is so wrong with our illegal immigration system. The Home Office is simultaneously funding an app that allows illegal immigrants to find work even more easily while still funneling money to those who get removed. If we continue to market Britain as a land of taxpayer-funded perks for those who bypass our laws, we should not be surprised when the boats keep coming. The government must immediately review these contracts and ensure that not another...",

  "title": "Regulation, Private Markets and the UK’s Growth Challenge",
  "text": "The government has been casting around for growth levers to lift the UK economy out of the doldrums. Yet shortly after its election victory it became apparent that Reeves and co lacked a credible growth strategy. Tax rises on business are unlikely to generate growth, and burdening firms with additional red tape through measures such as the Employment Rights Bill offers little incentive for investment or expansion. In any case, the government has turned to regulation, particularly financial regulation, as a potential driver of growth. The problem is that meaningful control over the regulatory burden faced by financial institutions has been delegated to a sprawling network of regulators that operate largely beyond direct government control. This leaves ministers with little more than rhetoric, rather than real levers to pull. This tension is illustrated in a new report from the Financial Services Regulation Committee examining the growth of private markets since the Global Financial Crisis. The report focuses on two key areas. First, private equity, where funds pool capital from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to invest in companies with the aim of improving performance, restructuring, or driving growth before exiting via sale or public listing. Second, private credit, which involves non-bank lenders, typically private credit funds, providing debt finance through bespoke, negotiated arrangements rather than through traditional bank lending or public bond markets. Private markets have expanded dramatically since 2008 , with growth most pronounced in the United States, which now accounts for roughly three-quarters of global private market activity. The UK is the second-largest market. This expansion presents both opportunities and risks for the UK economy. How the government and regulators respond will be a critical test of their stated desire to foster a greater risk appetite and support growth. The UK is a global leader in private markets. That position should be embraced rather than undermined by excessive caution or regulatory overreach. The report makes clear that the growth of private markets has, in part, been driven by regulation itself. Post-crisis reforms, particularly stricter bank capital and liquidity requirements, have deliberately pushed banks away from riskier lending. While this has strengthened financial stability, it has also left parts of the real economy, especially SMEs, underserved. The report notes that regulatory requirements have made SME lending more expensive for banks, reflecting higher capital costs and risk weightings. Although banks remain the dominant source of finance in the UK, their share of total lending to the real economy has fallen from 85 per cent in 2008 to 80 per cent in 2024. This retreat has real economic consequences. These pressures have prompted the Chancellor to call for a review of capital requirements and reforms to the MREL framework, the minimum levels of loss-absorbing capital and debt banks must hold. But the wider effect of regulation has been to push demand for finance into areas operating largely outside the regulatory perimeter altogether, a phenomenon called regulatory arbitrage. The clampdown on regulated finance has therefore had a dual effect. It has constrained...",

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Keystone-SDA Die Schweizer Nachrichtenagentur Der russische Präsident Wladimir Putin (73) hat nach Kremlangaben über diplomatische Kanäle eine Einladung der USA zur Teilnahme am sogenannten Friedensrat für den Gazastreifen erhalten. «Derzeit prüfen wir alle Details dieses Angebots, zudem hoffen wir auf Kontakte mit der amerikanischen Seite, um alle Nuancen zu klären», sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow der russischen Nachrichtenagentur Interfax zufolge. Russland unterhält Kontakte sowohl zu Israel als auch zur Palästinenser-Führung und zur Terrororganisation Hamas. In Moskau stiess die Einladung in das von US-Präsident Donald Trump geplante Gremium auch deshalb auf Wohlwollen, weil Russland sich traditionell als wichtiger Akteur im Nahen Osten sieht und dort eigene geopolitische Interessen verfolgt. Zudem sieht sich Kremlchef Putin damit ungeachtet seines Angriffskriegs gegen die Ukraine willkommen auf internationaler Bühne. Kontroverse Entscheidung Putin hatte auch immer wieder Trumps Bemühungen um ein Ende des russischen Angriffskriegs gegen die Ukraine begrüsst. Allerdings ist dort ein Frieden nicht in Sicht. Einladungen für den «Friedensrat» erhielten etwa auch der türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ägyptens Staatschef Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (71) und Argentiniens Präsident Javier Milei (55). Auch der Machthaber in Belarus, Alexander Lukaschenko, hat nach Angaben aus Minsk, eine Einladung bekommen. «Wir sind bereit, uns an der Aktivität des ‹Friedensrats› und rechnen und hoffen darauf, dass die Organisation ihren Rahmen und ihre Vollmachten stark über die Grenzen der Initiative erweitert», sagte der Sprecher des belarussischen Aussenministeriums Ruslan Warankow dazu. Wer soll im Gremium sitzen? Das Gremium ist Teil der zweiten Phase von Trumps Friedensplan für Gaza , die ein dauerhaftes Kriegsende und die Entwaffnung der islamistischen Terrororganisation Hamas vorsieht, was diese ablehnt. Das internationale Gremium soll die neue Übergangsregierung des im Krieg zwischen der Hamas und Israel weitgehend zerstörten Küstenstreifens beaufsichtigen. Trump selbst hat den Vorsitz. Dem Gremium gehören nach Angaben des Weissen Hauses unter anderem der frühere britische Premier Tony Blair, US-Aussenminister Marco Rubio, Trumps Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und der US-Sondergesandte Steve Witkoff an.",

Mehr anzeigen Guido Felder Ausland-Redaktor Zollhammer, Bombenangriffe, Grönland-Anspruch: In nur einem Jahr Amtszeit ist es Donald Trump (79) gelungen, die Welt immer wieder in Schockstarre zu versetzen. Zuletzt, als er die rücksichtslose Übernahme der zu Dänemark gehörenden Insel Grönland angekündigt und jenen Ländern, die sich dagegen sträuben, mit weiteren Strafzöllen gedroht hat. Diese Woche wollen europäische Staaten entscheiden, ob sie auf weitere Strafzölle mit Milliardengegenzöllen reagieren wollen. Es ist aber möglich, dass der weltweite Zollkonflikt plötzlich verpufft. Und das ausgerechnet am Tag, an dem Trump ein Jahr im Amt ist. Am Dienstag wird der Oberste Gerichtshof der USA, der Supreme Court, tagen. Zwar gibt das Gericht seine Themen im Voraus nicht bekannt. US-Medien erwarten aber das Urteil zu einer Frage, das schon seit November pendent ist: Sind Trumps globale Strafzölle rechtmässig oder nicht? 1/8 In den vergangenen Tagen haben Dänemark und verbündete Staaten vorübergehend Soldaten nach Grönland verlegt. Foto: 235 Milliarden abgeknöpft Donald Trump hat im vergangenen Jahr zum grossen, weltweiten Zollkrieg geblasen. Wegen Handelsdefiziten hat er die EU mit einem Strafzoll von 15 Prozent belegt. Auch die Schweiz kam, nach einem anfänglichen Hammer von 39 Prozent, schliesslich mit 15 Prozent Zoll davon. Der US-Bundeskasse bescherte dies im vergangenen Jahr rund 235 Milliarden Dollar Zolleinnahmen. Jetzt hat Trump weitere Strafzölle angekündigt. Die Drohung richtet sich gegen jene Staaten, die eine Annexion Grönlands durch die USA ablehnen. Das sind zurzeit Dänemark, Schweden, Norwegen, Deutschland, Frankreich, Grossbritannien, die Niederlande und Kanada. Die Strafzölle sollen ab Februar 10 Prozent und ab Juni 25 Prozent betragen. Das wollen sich die europäischen Staaten nicht länger gefallen lassen. Falls Trump nicht endlich die Finger von Grönland lässt, will die EU Gegenzölle beschliessen. Sie sollen unter anderem auf US-Bourbon, Flugzeugteile, Sojabohnen und Geflügel erhoben werden und ein Volumen von 93 Milliarden Euro umfassen. Gericht könnte Trump stoppen Brisant: Trump-Kenner erwarten, dass das Oberste Gericht Trump stoppen wird. Philipp Adorf, USA-Experte an der Universität Bonn, sagt gegenüber Blick: «Ich rechne eher mit einem für Trump problematischen, tendenziell negativen Urteil.» Die rechtliche Basis der Strafzölle sei dünn. «Der Supreme Court dürfte Schwierigkeiten haben, diese Konstruktion aufrechtzuerhalten, ohne die Budget- und Handelshoheit des Kongresses weiter auszuhöhlen», meint Adorf. Denkbar ist laut Adorf aber auch, dass das Gericht einen Mittelweg findet und die Zölle nicht pauschal kippt. «Es könnte ihre Anwendung eng begrenzen – etwa durch klarere Kriterien für nationale Sicherheits- oder Notstandszölle, zeitliche Begrenzungen oder eine stärkere Rückbindung präsidialer Ermessensspielräume an den Kongress.» Rufe nach Amtsenthebung möglich Während ein für Trump positives Urteil dem US-Präsidenten freie Bahn geben und er dieses Instrument auch als politisches Druckmittel weiter ausbauen dürfte, wäre ein negatives Urteil eine grosse Schmach. Dann würde sich der Konflikt in den Kongress verlagern. Adorf: «Dort ist die Unterstützung für Trumps Zollkurs äusserst begrenzt.» Da auch seine Grönland-Politik auf Widerstand stösst, könnte sich der Widerstand...",

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Lucien Fluri Co-Ressortleiter Politik Es begann mit einem Streit zwischen Deutschschweizer und welschen Rekruten. Deutschschweizer Rekruten korrigierten in der Kaserne Payerne VD die Kleidung ihrer welschen Kollegen, was diese gar nicht goutierten. Auf das Wortgefecht folgte Mobbing, es endete mit Rassismus. Ein Rekrut aus der Deutschschweiz verschickte im Whatsapp-Gruppenchat «Zug Dütschschwitzer» ein Video, in dem einer der dunkelhäutigen Westschweizer Rekruten tanzte. «Scheiss N…» schrieb er dazu. Dann kam die Beschimpfung «Hurensohn». «... gerade noch als leicht einzustufen» Und schliesslich überschlagen sich die Nachrichten im Chat für einen kurzen Moment: ein aufgeschlitzter weiblicher Torso, der von einem schwarzen Penis penetriert wurde, ein Schalthebel eines Autos in der Form eines Hakenkreuzes, ein Bild des deutschen Nazi-Diktators Adolf Hitler und der ehemaligen Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel. Bei Hitler stand «Gute Zeiten», bei Merkel hiess es «schlechte Zeiten». Und dann kam noch ein Bild eines Hitlergrusses. Für seine Bildposts mit «gewalttätigen, rassistischen, nationalsozialistischen sowie diskriminierenden Ideologien» muss der 22-jährige Rekrut nun 360 Franken Busse und 450 Franken Verfahrenskosten bezahlen. Eine Strafe über 15 Tagessätze à 120 Franken setzte die Militärjustiz zur Bewährung aus. Das Verschulden sei «gerade noch als leicht einzustufen». Weiterer Fall aufgetaucht Blick hat die Urteile der Militärjustiz aus den vergangenen Monaten angeschaut. Es ist nicht der einzige Fall von rassistischen Whatsapp-Posts. Auch im Rekrutierungszentrum Rüti ZH kam es zu Entgleisungen. Rekrut S. verschickte Bilder, die laut Justiz «menschenverachtende, rassistische Grundhaltungen» zeigten – und Kinderpornografie beinhalteten. Er verschickte Hitlerbilder, Sexszenen mit Hitlergruss und Hakenkreuzen. Sechs rassistische Posts innert elf Minuten. Darunter eine Tafel mit der Aufschrift «Juden werden hier nicht bedient». Es sei quasi nur ein einziger Vorfall, weshalb das Unrecht eher gering ist, schreibt die Militärjustiz – «ohne die Tat bagatellisieren zu wollen». Der Mann löschte den Chat auch bald wieder. Alkohol war bereits geflossen. Er habe lustig sein und dazugehören wollen, sagte der Rekrut mit sonst makellosem Führungszeugnis. Und er schämte sich für die Tat. Zehn Tagessätze zu 100 Franken, bedingt. 200 Franken Busse und 450 Franken Verfahrenskosten, so das Urteil. Ist das Militär besser als die Zivilgesellschaft? Ob es in der Armee häufiger oder seltener zu rassistischen Vorfällen kommt als im Rest der Bevölkerung, lässt sich nicht erhärten. Militärsoziologe Tibor Szvircsev Tresch hat vor einigen Jahren eine Umfrage verfasst. Am Ende der RS hatten zehn Prozent der Rekruten einen rassistischen Vorfall miterlebt, unter Personen mit Migrationshintergrund waren es 16 Prozent. Interessant dabei: «Rekruten mit Migrationshintergrund gaben an, dass die Hautfarbe im Zivilleben eine stärkere Rolle spielt», so Szvircsev Tresch, der an der Militärakademie der ETH Zürich lehrt. Gleichzeitig aber verbringe man in der Armee sieben Tage die Woche mit Personen, die man sich nicht selbst...",

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Mattia Jutzeler Redaktor News Es brodelt im hohen atlantischen Norden. US-Präsident Donald Trump (79) möchte sich Grönland einverleiben. Jedem, der sich ihm in den Weg stellt, droht er mit seiner Lieblingswaffe: Strafzöllen. Insgesamt acht EU-Staaten , darunter Frankreich und Deutschland, möchte Trump so zum Rückzug zwingen. Jetzt hat der französische Präsident Emmanuel Macron (48) die Aktivierung der mächtigsten EU-Handelswaffe ins Spiel gebracht : Das «Instrument zur Bekämpfung von Zwangsmassnahmen», umgangssprachlich auch «Handelsbazooka» genannt. Dieses Instrument wurde vor zwei Jahren von der EU geschaffen, um sich gegen wirtschaftliche Nötigung zu wehren. Tiefgreifende Reaktionsmassnahmen möglich Kommt die Handelsbazooka zum Einsatz, könnte die EU etwa die Zulassung von amerikanischen Produkten in Europa stoppen, wie die Kommission auf ihrer Webseite schreibt. Auch könnten US-Unternehmen von öffentlichen Aufträgen ausgeschlossen oder zu zusätzlichen Abgaben gezwungen werden. Trump droht mit Annexion Mit Video Streit um Grönland Mit Video Neuer Zollhammer gegen Europa Mit Video Wegen Streit um Grönland Neuer US-Bundesstaat? Frankreich kann die Handelsbazooka aber nicht im Alleingang abfeuern. Zuerst müsste die EU-Kommission die Aktivierung des Instruments beschliessen. Ausserdem müsste eine qualifizierte Mehrheit der Mitgliedsstaaten, also mindestens 15 der 27 EU-Länder, für eine Aktivierung stimmen. Für die EU sei die Bazooka aber eher als Massnahme zur Abschreckung gedacht, schreibt der «Spiegel». Das Instrument wird erst dann aktiviert, wenn alle anderen diplomatischen Bemühungen gescheitert sind. Dazu gehören etwa direkte Verhandlungen mit dem Aggressor oder gerichtliche Entscheide. Macron wollte die Wirtschaftswaffe bereits während des letzten Zollstreits mit Trump im Sommer 2025 aktivieren. Die EU-Kommission einigte sich allerdings auf einen Deal mit der US-Regierung. Aktivierung vielleicht erst nach Stichtag Ob die Handelsbazooka dieses Mal also tatsächlich zum Einsatz kommt, bleibt fraglich. Laut dem Nachrichtenportal «Euractiv» spürt Macron für seine Idee bereits Gegenwind. Besonders die italienische Ministerpräsidentin Giorgia Meloni (49) stelle sich gegen die Aktivierung der Handelswaffe. Meloni hat allgemein ein gutes Verhältnis zu Trump . Auch die EU-Kommission selbst hat am Montag bekannt gegeben, im Grönland-Konflikt mit den USA vorerst auf Dialog setzen zu wollen. Die von Trump angedrohten Zölle sollen ab dem 1. Februar in Kraft treten. Wie «Euractiv» schreibt, will die EU momentan erst nach diesem Stichtag über eine mögliche Aktivierung der Handelsbazooka entscheiden. Der EU-Ratspräsident António Costa (64) möchte am Donnerstag allerdings einen Dringlichkeitsgipfel ansetzen, um über weitere Schritte in der Grönland-Frage zu diskutieren. Der Termin sei allerdings noch nicht endgültig festgelegt.",

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Daniel Macher Redaktor News Für die einen gilt Gregory Bovino (57) als harter Hund, einer, der endlich durchgreift im Kampf gegen illegale Migration. So wie es Donald Trump (79) bereits vor seiner ersten Amtszeit versprochen hatte. Kritiker beschreiben den Sohn italienischer Einwanderer als Hardliner, der rechtsstaatliche Grenzen überschreite und mit seinen Auftritten ein Klima der Angst gegenüber Migranten, aber auch gegenüber Minderheiten insgesamt schüre. Seit Wochen dreht sich die Gewaltspirale in Minneapolis im US-Bundesstaat Minnesota. Auf der einen Seite die ICE-Beamten, die im Rahmen der Operation «Metro Surge» illegale Einwanderer aufspüren und festnehmen sollen. Auf der anderen Seite protestieren Bürgerinnen und Bürger gegen das Vorgehen der knapp 3000 Beamten und dokumentieren die Einsätze, um Vorfälle zu belegen. Denn immer wieder kommt es zu Gewaltexzessen, bei denen auch unschuldige Zivilisten betroffen sind. Ihren Höhepunkt erreichten diese mit der mutmasslichen Ermordung von Renée Good (†37) am 7. Januar durch einen ICE-Beamten. Seitdem eskalieren die Proteste in der 430'000-Einwohner-Stadt regelmässig. Sauer auf «korrupte Politiker» Aufstände in Minnesota Mit Video Wegen Protesten gegen ICE Zwei Menschen im Spital «Warum sieht er aus wie Hitler?» Für Trumps Chef für Grenzschutz scheint es nicht oberste Priorität zu haben, die Lage zu entschärfen, wie man nach den Bildern von vergangener Woche vermuten kann. Bovino marschiert bei einem Besuch durch die Strassen von Minneapolis – flankiert von schwer bewaffneten Bundesbeamten –, gekleidet in einen auffällig langen, olivgrünen Mantel mit Abzeichen seiner Behörde. Goldene Knöpfe, kantiger Schnitt, dazu eine streng gebundene Krawatte und ein dunkler Schal. In den sozialen Medien lässt die Reaktion nicht lange auf sich warten. Mehrere Nutzer vergleichen Bovinos Outfit mit Uniformen aus der Nazizeit, sprechen von «Nazi-Cosplay» und ziehen Parallelen zu den langen Mänteln, wie sie einst von Funktionären des NS-Regimes getragen wurden. «Warum sieht er aus wie Hitler?», fragt ein User unverblümt. Ein anderer schreibt: «Chief Greg Bovino läuft durch Minneapolis in seinem massgeschneiderten Nazi-Mantel und schikaniert Patrioten.» Bovino zeigt Gesicht – als Einziger Bovino selbst äussert sich bislang nicht zu den Vorwürfen. Unklar bleibt auch, ob der Mantel Teil einer offiziellen Uniform ist – oder eine persönliche Wahl. Auffällig ist jedenfalls: Unter den mehr als einem Dutzend ihn begleitenden Beamten ist er der Einzige, der dieses Kleidungsstück trägt. Während seine Eskorte mit Sturmgewehren, kugelsicheren Westen und teils mit Masken ausgerüstet ist, zeigt Bovino demonstrativ sein Gesicht. Auf Videoaufnahmen ist zudem zu hören, wie der Grenzschutz-Chef Demonstranten anschreit und sie von der Strasse weist. «Runter von der Strasse», ruft er, während Protestierende ihn als «Braunhemd» beschimpfen – eine Anspielung auf die paramilitärischen Nazi-Schlägertrupps der SA.",

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Patrik Berger und Keystone-SDA Die US-Strafzölle belasten nicht die ausländischen Exporteure, sondern die amerikanische Wirtschaft selbst. Das zeigt eine Studie des Instituts für Weltwirtschaft (IfW) im norddeutschen Kiel. Die Wirtschaftsforscher analysierten über 25 Millionen Lieferdatensätze mit einem Gesamtwert von fast vier Billionen US-Dollar an US-Importen. Dabei seien die Ergebnisse eindeutig: Die US-Zolleinnahmen stiegen im vergangenen Jahr um rund 200 Milliarden US-Dollar. Doch nur etwa vier Prozent der Zolllast trugen ausländische Exporteure, während 96 Prozent auf US-Käufer abgewälzt wurden. Gleichzeitig brach das Handelsvolumen ein, ohne dass die Exportpreise sanken. Zölle verteuern importierte Waren «Die Zölle sind ein Eigentor», sagt Julian Hinz (37), Forschungsdirektor am IfW und Mitautor der Studie. «Die Behauptung, dass ausländische Staaten diese Zölle tragen, ist ein Mythos.» Die Zölle verteuerten importierte Waren wie eine Konsumsteuer und verringerten zugleich Vielfalt und Menge der verfügbaren Güter. Mit Video Börsen-Ticker Taucher zum Wochenstart Interview Ex-Berater John Bolton rät Jobs gehen nach Indien Zudem untersuchte die Studie die Zollerhöhungen gegen Brasilien und Indien im August 2025. Dabei stiegen die Zölle für Brasilien auf 50 Prozent und für Indien von 25 auf 50 Prozent. Laut IfW zeigen die Daten, dass ausländische Exporteure in der Folge ihre Preise nicht senkten, um die zusätzlichen Zölle abzufedern . Margen von US-Unternehmen sinken Ein Vergleich indischer Exporte in die USA mit Lieferungen nach Europa oder Kanada zeige zudem ein klares Muster. Hinz erklärt: «Exportwert und -menge nach Amerika sanken deutlich, um bis zu 24 Prozent. Aber die Stückpreise – die Preise, die indische Exporteure verlangen - blieben unverändert.» Das heisst, es wird weniger geliefert, aber nicht günstiger. Die Studie ergab unter dem Strich, dass US-Unternehmen langfristig mit sinkenden Margen und Verbraucher mit höheren Preisen rechnen müssen. Gleichzeitig verkauften exportorientierte Länder mit Schwerpunkt USA weniger und stünden unter Druck, neue Märkte zu erschliessen. «Die Zölle bringen langfristig Nachteile für alle», betonte der Studienmitautor Hinz.

Mehr erfahren Feedback senden Mehr anzeigen Daniel Ballmer und Keystone-SDA Als wäre der Verlust des Nationalratsmandats nicht schon ärgerlich genug. Im Oktober 2023 hatte die Genfer Grüne Isabelle Pasquier (52) ihre Wiederwahl in die Grosse Kammer verpasst. Ohne Amt meldete sie sich bei der Arbeitslosenversicherung (ALV) an. Nach der Logik der Genfer Arbeitslosenkasse aber hätte sie sich auf Jobsuche begeben sollen, statt Wahlkampf und Politik zu betreiben. Das Bundesgericht hat nun entschieden, dass der Frau zu Unrecht Taggelder gestrichen wurden. Mangelnde Bemühungen bei der Stellensuche Nach ihrer Nichtwiederwahl meldete sich Pasquier Ende November bei der Genfer Arbeitslosenkasse an. Der Beginn der Rahmenfrist für den Bezug von Taggeldern wurde auf den Tag nach Beendigung ihres Mandats, auf den 4. Dezember, festgelegt. Im Januar darauf entschied die Arbeitslosenkasse, dass ihre Arbeitslosenentschädigung für zwölf Tage eingestellt werde. Auf Einsprache der Betroffenen hin reduzierte die Kasse die Streichung der Taggelder auf neun Tage, wie aus einem am Montag publizierten Urteil des Bundesgerichts hervorgeht. 135'000 Franken gefordert Wegen Denkmalschutz Wegen Nötigung! Mit Video Frist verpasst Die Kasse begründete die Einstelltage mit mangelnden Bemühungen bei der Stellensuche. Das Nationalratsmandat stellte sie einem befristeten Vertrag gleich. Pasquier hätte gemäss Kasse deshalb drei Monate vor Ende des Mandats mit der Stellensuche beginnen müssen. Für den September habe sie keine Nachweise dafür erbracht und für die beiden darauffolgenden Monate zu wenige. Stellensuche statt Wahlkampf? Diese Argumentation hat das Bundesgericht in einem kurzen, aber klaren Urteil verworfen. Es stützt die Sichtweise der früheren Politikerin, die sich in ihrer Beschwerde auf ihre politischen Rechte und das Funktionieren der Demokratie im Allgemeinen berief. Auch wenn die Entschädigung der Nationalräte als Einkommen aus unselbständiger Tätigkeit gelte, komme ein solches Mandat laut Bundesgericht nicht einem befristeten Arbeitsvertrag gleich. Wer sich zur Wahl stelle, nehme seine verfassungsmässig garantierten politischen Rechte wahr. Eine Nichtwiederwahl könne zwar zu einer Erwerbslosigkeit führen. Deshalb könne von den jeweiligen Personen aber nicht verlangt werden, dass sie darauf verzichten, ihre politischen Rechte wahrzunehmen. Sie müssten sonst beispielsweise den Wahlkampf zugunsten der Stellensuche zurückstellen. Widersprüchliches Verhalten gegenüber potenzieller Arbeitgeber Würde ausserdem von Bundesparlamentariern erwartet, sich vor Neuwahlen auf Stellensuche zu begeben, müssten sie sich gegenüber möglichen Arbeitgebern widersprüchlich verhalten. Eine Kandidatur zu verschweigen, sei wegen der Wahlkampagne kaum möglich. Die Alternative sei, entgegen der tatsächlichen Absicht den Stellenantritt auch bei Wiederwahl zu beteuern. Ein solches Verhalten würde die Wahlchancen wohl kaum erhöhen, wenn es an die Öffentlichkeit käme.",

The project will represent a corporate investment exceeding $20 billion and will create hundreds of permanent jobs throughout DeSoto County. xAI has purchased and is retrofitting a building to house the new data center operations. The data center, which will be known as MACROHARDRR, is in proximity to xAI’s newly acquired power plant site in Southaven and one of the company’s existing data centers in Tennessee. Upon completion, the Southaven data center will increase the company’s computing power to nearly 2 gigawatts. In addition to building rehabilitation, xAI’s substantial investment will also provide tax revenue to support public safety, health and human services, education, fire fighters, police, parks and other initiatives that benefit the City of Southaven. The Mississippi Development Authority has approved xAI for its Data Center Incentive, which provides a sales and use tax exemption for all computing and equipment software used by companies certified as data centers by the agency. The City of Southaven and DeSoto County are also supporting xAI’s projects through fee-in-lieu agreements. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, xAI was founded in 2023 to develop advanced AI technologies to accomplish its mission to understand the universe. The company operates in the AI, social media and technology sectors. Its flagship product is Grok, a generative AI chatbot integrated with the social media platform X. The company also offers application programming interface tools such as image generation, voice and agent tools, along with the xAI For Government suite of products for American federal, state and local government uses. The company expects to begin data center operations in Southaven in February 2026. QUOTES “This record-shattering $20 billion investment is an amazing start to what is sure to be another incredible year for economic development in Mississippi. Today, Elon Musk is bringing xAI to DeSoto County, a project that will transform the region and bring amazing opportunities to its residents for generations. This is the largest economic development project in Mississippi’s history. It sets the pace for continued high-tech investments across our state and strengthens Mississippi’s position as a leader in this exciting tech revolution. There is truly no better time to invest in Mississippi.” – Gov. Tate Reeves “xAI is scaling at an immeasurable pace — we are building our third massive data center in the greater Memphis area. MACROHARDRR pushes our Colossus training compute to ~2GW – by far the most powerful AI system on Earth. This is insane execution speed by xAI and the state of Mississippi. We are grateful to Governor Reeves for his support of building xAI at warp speed.” – xAI CEO Elon Musk “Starting off 2026 with a $20 billion investment by xAI is a clear sign Mississippi is not letting up on the economic momentum we have built over the last few years.

  "text": "Largest private-sector investment in Warren County history will bring at least 200 new jobs and expand education and training programs Jackson, Miss. (November 20, 2025) – Governor Tate Reeves today announced that Amazon is planning to invest $3 billion in Warren County to build a new data center campus. This investment is expected to create at least 200 high-paying full-time jobs and support more than 300 additional positions in the region. This investment builds upon Amazon’s previous commitment to Mississippi. In January 2024, Amazon announced plans to invest at least $10 billion and create 1,000 direct jobs to establish data center campuses in Madison County. Since then, the company has created thousands of indirect jobs through data center construction, the supply chain and related services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud, enabling a new era of generative AI through strategic investments in advanced infrastructure, machine learning services, and agentic AI applications. Today’s announcement in Warren County, alongside previous commitments made across the U.S. in recent months, further strengthens investments in generative AI and high-tech cloud infrastructure. These efforts reflect Amazon’s ongoing commitment to supporting U.S. leadership in AI and helping customers across all industries harness AI-driven solutions to transform operations and accelerate innovation. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies, rely on AWS to advance their AI journey, lower costs, increase agility, and drive innovation. These strategic investments in advanced computing infrastructure and specialized AI hardware are building the technology backbone for the next generation of generative and agentic AI and helping to secure America’s position at the forefront of global innovation. Previous Mississippi Major Economic Impact Authority legislation approved for Amazon’s Madison County data center complexes will be made available for the Vicksburg project. Warren County also is contributing to the project. Additionally, Entergy Mississippi’s commitment to meeting long-term power requirements was a key factor in the company’s decision to expand into Vicksburg. Construction of the Vicksburg data center complex is expected to begin in 2026. QUOTES “Mississippi has built an economy that attracts world-class investment,” said Governor Tate Reeves. “This $3 billion investment by Amazon is the largest in Warren County’s history and another massive win for our state.

  "text": "﻿ Jackson, Miss. – Gov. Tate Reeves and Mississippi Development Authority have unveiled a bold new branding initiative: “Let’s Break New Ground.” Created in partnership with Ridgeland-based The Ramey Agency, the new campaign conveys the state’s commitment to bringing new investments and good-paying job opportunities to Mississippians through its pro-business policies and favorable business environment. “When it comes to economic development, Mississippi is breaking new ground for business and its people. This brand campaign highlights our state’s pioneering spirit, the strength of our partnerships and our willingness to think creatively to help businesses succeed,” said Governor Tate Reeves. “We’ve experienced record-breaking economic development successes over the last few years. As the economic landscape evolves across sectors, we are excited to ‘break new ground’ and further expand both our diverse portfolio of industries and opportunities for Mississippians.” Earlier this month, Gov. Reeves announced Compass Datacenters is locating in Lauderdale County, a project that will create thousands of jobs and will represent a $10 billion investment at full build-out. Last year, substantial investments from companies like Amazon Web Services, Amplify Cell Technologies, Liebherr and PCC Gulf Chem were announced throughout the state. These four projects combined represent nearly $12.8 billion in new capital investments and the creation of nearly 3,500 jobs. The “Let’s Break New Ground” initiative reflects the state’s proactive approach to recruiting these types of game-changing projects. This includes a commitment to explore new possibilities and embrace a fresh perspective to increase speed to market. It also emphasizes several key attributes that make Mississippi a top destination for business: a streamlined process with less red tape and innovative incentives; collaboration with local leaders, utilities and educational institutions to reduce risk; and flexibility to tailor solutions that benefit both businesses and local communities. “Mississippi has a proven track record of delivering results for businesses,” said MDA Executive Director Bill Cork. “With ‘Let’s Break New Ground,’ we’re sending a clear message that Mississippi is the place where innovation meets opportunity. We’re ready to roll up our sleeves and work alongside companies so they can go from investing money to making money in record time.

  "text": "From the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro to controversy involving the conduct of ICE immigration agents, the actions of the Trump administration have already caused substantial international and domestic turbulence in just the first few days of 2026. Below, we’ve selected some of the best of continuing coverage of these and related issues. While President Trump and his administration’s foreign policy creates debate over international law and conduct, his unorthodox behaviour both domestically and internationally has also received criticism in terms of disregard for ethics and for presidential norms, as this podcast explores. President Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration has provoked mass protest, most recently following the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in early January. The enforcement tactics have raised difficult legal and constitutional issues and may come to define Trump’s second term. Early in his second term, Trump tasked a ‘Weaponization Working Group’ at the Department of Justice to scrutinise officials who had previously investigated him. He has since demanded that the department prosecute those who have opposed him, raising concerns over the department's independence. In Argentina’s recent legislative elections, Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won nearly 41 per cent of the vote in an unprecedented victory. But the result has brought attention to the influence of the US over Argentina, particularly following Trump’s $40bn bailout offer in the weeks leading up to the midterms. Serious questions are being raised about President Trump’s repeated reliance on misinformation, apparent cognitive lapses and the risks his leadership poses to US stability. The debate as to whether the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment could be used to remove a sitting president has therefore been reopened. The approach to international institutions, cooperation and development from the current US administration has significant implications for areas such as soft power and global justice. This podcast considers these issues and features speakers with senior experience in previous US administrations. Trump’s ‘America First’ policy has seen the US reassess its relationship with the United Nations and its position on the world stage. Cuts to USAID have led to significant funding issues for the global aid system, and the future relationship between the US and the UN remains uncertain. John Bellinger is a former senior legal advisor to the US State Department and the National Security Council during the George W Bush administration. In this interview, Bellinger discusses his experiences and how the approach of previous administrations compares to that of Trump 2.0.",

  "text": "Activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was fatally shot in September 2025 while speaking at a campus event in Utah. The killing of Kirk – which took place on the same day as a shooting at a high school in Colorado – illustrates the need for greater gun control in the US. Below, we’ve selected some of the best of 's continuing coverage of these and related issues. After a series of shootings drew national attention and prompted renewed calls for an assault weapon ban and other gun controls, then-US President Joe Biden asked in a speech, ‘Why in God’s name do we allow these weapons of war in our streets and at our schools?’ He was speaking a day after six people were killed with an AR-15-style rifle at a school in Tennessee. The US Bipartisan Safer Communities Act introduced measures including a crackdown on interstate gun trafficking and straw purchasing, whereby an agent purchases a gun on behalf of another, as well as $250m in funding for community violence intervention programmes. Many hailed the legislation as ‘just the start’. Civilian guns kill ten times the number of Americans each year as the number of fatalities on the bloodiest day in United States history, on the Civil War battlefield at Antietam. By contrast, the European Union loses only one tenth as many lives to civilian guns each year as the combatants lost on the bloodiest day at the Battle of the Somme. The Pacific nation introduced swift and sweeping reforms of gun laws following the mass shooting in Christchurch in 2019, which killed 51 people and saw 50 others wounded. The country’s Parliament subsequently voted 119-1 to introduce a nationwide ban on semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles, a move that highlights the lack of action to tackle gun violence in the US. In 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced a new executive order that further tightened legislation around the number of firearms civilians are allowed. It also introduced additional regulations for hunters, target shooters and gun collectors, as well as new rules for the transportation of privately-owned firearms.",

  "text": "Growing conflict and instability are pushing an increasing number of people into extreme poverty and destitution, with the ongoing famine in some parts of Gaza just one example. The situation further emphasises the importance of humanitarian aid, a sector facing great challenges. Below, we’ve selected some of the best of 's continuing coverage of these and related issues. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on food crises, issued a report confirming famine in Gaza’s largest city and surrounding areas. By the end of July, the World Health Organization had recorded 74 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza in 2025, with 63 occurring in July alone. The US was the world's largest donor of overseas development aid in 2024, contributing almost $62bn. However, the Trump administration is now cutting 83 per cent of USAID programmes and reducing its staff to only 15 positions, a decision that will have far-reaching repercussions worldwide. assesses the consequences for the aid sector. The World Bank has reported that almost half of the world's population is living in poverty, subsisting on less than $6.85 per day. Since the 1990s, extreme poverty had been steadily declining, but this progress has stalled in recent years due to lower economic growth and major events, including an increase in conflicts and instability around the world.  The UN has confirmed that 2024 was the deadliest year on record for humanitarian personnel. The Aid Worker Security Database recorded the deaths of 344 aid workers, surpassing the 2023 total of 280. Aid workers rely on the protection of the government hosting the humanitarian operations; states may therefore be in breach of international law by denying them this security. Following the Trump administration's suspension of funding for mine clearance in Cambodia, Beijing has stepped up to fill the void in the project, with a non-repayable grant of $4.4m to support the clearance of more than 3,400 hectares of mine-affected land. The move is symbolic of how China is poised to fill the vacuum left as the US retreats from world leadership. Once a leader of Palestinian solidarity synonymous with Arab defiance, Egypt is cracking down on protests over the starvation of the people of Gaza. In June, enforcers targeted international activists for attempting to break Israel's siege of the region, detaining them at airports, dragging them from hotels and even beating them on camera. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted significant concerns about food security, notably after Russian restrictions affecting goods leaving the country left 22 million tonnes of wheat stuck in Ukraine for five months. Countries reliant on imports, such as those in the Middle East and North Africa, are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of conflict for global supply chains.",

  "text": "In the US, a federal judge ruled that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in LA in response to protests against raids by the country's immigration enforcement agency was illegal. The Supreme Court has since ruled that ICE agents can continue to stop suspects without 'reasonable suspicion', permitting them to question individuals based solely on their race, language or job. These rulings come as President Trump's sweeping immigration raids continue, part of the growing trend of governments cracking down on migrants and refugees globally. Below, we’ve selected some of the best of 's continuing coverage of these and related issues. President Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration has provoked mass protest and involved the domestic deployment of the US military in LA, a move that has since been ruled as illegal by a federal judge. The enforcement tactics have raised difficult legal and constitutional issues and may come to define Trump’s second term. As millions of refugees spill from the world’s conflict zones, it’s often the most beleaguered and impoverished countries that are bearing the brunt. Chad and Ethiopia have accepted tens of thousands of refugees from Sudan and Somalia respectively, despite being among the world’s poorest countries. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the displacement of millions of Ukrainians. This podcast explores the unprecedented reaction to the plight of Ukrainian refugees and the need for a coordinated, compassionate international response, and assesses the situation for displaced people from other conflict zones, such as Afghanistan. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia highlights the clash between President Trump and the US judiciary as the administration pursues its mass deportation drive. The Salvadorean was deported alongside dozens of Venezuelans who likewise were given no chance to dispute their removal. Facing growing social and political pressure, the UK government is looking to redesign the UK’s immigration system to ‘significantly’ reduce net migration. Proposed measures include tougher visa requirements, higher skills standards for graduates and workers, and ending overseas recruitment for the social care sector. The fall of Afghanistan to Taliban forces in August 2021 has led to millions fleeing the country to escape the new regime. In this feature, Global Insight examines how threats to, and gaps within, international refugee protection regimes may undermine the assistance owed to those who have fled the Taliban. As crises in the Middle East and North Africa drive migrants to its shores, the EU is looking towards further deals with third countries to curb the number of people entering the bloc. However, the human rights records of these countries raise questions about Member States’ international protection responsibilities. Millions have been displaced as a direct result of the climate crisis, as the world faces rising sea levels and an increasing number of extreme weather events. Ian Fry, former UN Special Rapporteur on climate change and human rights, discusses the challenges faced by climate refugees and their lack of legal protection. Since 2011 more than six million Syrians have been forced to flee the country in search of...",

  "text": "US President Donald Trump has said he plans to sue the BBC for up to $5bn over its editing of a speech he gave on 6 January 2021. The row marks the latest example of Trump threatening the media, part of a global trend in which the press is increasingly targeted by governments and powerful figures. Below, we’ve selected some of the best of 's continuing coverage of these and related issues. In the short time since it came to power, the Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. This feature assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it. Even before President Trump threatened to sue the BBC, there were concerns that he and allies are using government power and regulatory threats to suppress free speech and the media. Trump has suggested the FCC should revoke the licences of networks that broadcast negative coverage of him. An uncensored press is vital to the fundamental right to free expression and to democracy. And yet the profession of journalism is becoming more dangerous around the world. This showcase session assessed the threats to the press and the various forms they take. In February, the White House announced it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water. The White House also says it will exert greater control over which news outlets get access to the President. A free media is among the fundamental hallmarks of a society governed by the rule of law, yet journalists are increasingly being targeted simply for doing their jobs. This feature assesses the myriad challenges facing those who seek to protect the freedom of expression worldwide. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated the worst consequences of allowing powerful actors to exploit international legal systems. This podcast looks at the use of Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs), an intimidation tool frequently used to silence journalists. Hina Jilani is Co-Chair of the IBA's Human Rights Institute and a member of the High Level Panel of Legal Experts on Media Freedom, an independent body convened to promote a free and vibrant media. In this interview, she discusses blasphemy law and the criminalisation of hate speech. A number of recent trials and sentences have shown the full force of Hong Kong’s National Security Law (NSL), which was passed in 2020. Many media outlets have since closed operations in Hong Kong as China uses the NSL to crack down on pro-democracy sentiments in the territory. Following the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the UK government changed its definition of ‘extremism’ to strengthen its counterterrorism approach. But the broadness of the new definition has provoked criticism from human rights groups, who argue the change undermines freedom of speech.",

  "text": "IBAHRI condemns the conviction of Jimmy Lai and calls for urgent action to secure his release Monday 15 December 2025 The International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) condemns in the strongest possible terms the conviction of Jimmy Lai, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper in Hong Kong. His conviction was a foregone conclusion after a dishonestly conducted and politically motivated trial designed to destroy the most influential pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong under a veneer of legality. Jimmy Lai is a 78-year-old man, in ill-health, who has been held in solitary confinement for over 1,800 days. He is already serving a sentence of over five years in relation to a fraud dispute. His sentence per his conviction this month – a maximum of life imprisonment – now represents a death sentence unless urgent action is taken by world leaders to seek his release. The international community must respond with the outcry that this lawfare warrants. In particular, as Mr Lai is a British citizen, the IBAHRI calls upon the United Kingdom to negotiate his transfer to the UK immediately. This is a test of the UK government’s commitment to human rights and freedom of expression as Mr Lai must not be allowed to pay this price for his work defending democratic values. There is no doubt that Mr Lai's conviction for 'conspiracy to collude with foreign forces' and 'conspiracy to publish seditious material' under the National Security Law and colonial-era sedition law is in fact the criminalisation of his journalism. His conviction in spite of firm objection from world leaders, United Nations-appointed experts and international civil society threatens the tenets of our international rules-based order. The National Security Law has been widely condemned as being entirely contrary to international law, but it has been applied broadly in Hong Kong for political ends with impunity. Mr Lai's conviction is the final blow to Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law. It forms part of a broader trend of the arbitrary detention of thousands of opposition figures and independent journalists and activists, and the wholesale destruction of the independent press. Those serving as the last line of defence of democracy have been systematically wiped out, and Jimmy Lai has been made an example of to intimidate others into silence. This repression of those speaking out against human rights violations in Hong Kong has also crossed borders to become transnational. The suppression of independent voices both within Hong Kong and across borders must be more firmly addressed as a grave threat to national and international security.

  "title": "IBAHRI marks UN Genocide-prevention Day with parliamentary session on sexual and reproductive violence as tools of genocide",
  "text": "IBAHRI marks UN Genocide-prevention Day with parliamentary session on sexual and reproductive violence as tools of genocide Tuesday 9 December 2025 9 December – to mark the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of This Crime (Genocide-prevention Day), the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) convened a session in the United Kingdom’s Houses of Parliament titled Wounds Beyond War: Sexual and/or Reproductive Violence as Means of Genocide. The discussion brought legal experts, parliamentarians, and human rights practitioners together to examine how sexual and reproductive violence continues to be deployed against protected groups worldwide and how the international community should respond. Established by the United Nations General Assembly, UN Genocide-prevention Day serves to sharpen global attention on genocide as a distinct and preventable crime under international law. This year’s session took place against the backdrop of the highest number of active conflicts since 1946 and a growing body of evidence revealing systematic attacks on women, girls, men and boys that may meet the threshold of atrocity crimes, including genocide. Speaking at the event, Baroness Helena Kennedy of the Shaws LT KC, Director of the IBAHRI, and Peer in the UK House of Lords, underscored the urgent need for legal recognition and timely preventive action: ‘Recognising situations where sexual and/or reproductive violence is used as a means of genocide is key to ensuring that the crimes are addressed in the right way, including with legal steps. Even more so, and to implement our legal duty to prevent genocide, we must recognise situations where there is a serious risk of genocide and act to prevent the unimaginable pain and suffering imposed upon individuals and whole communities. Legal action can secure a sense of justice and accountability, but it cannot take away the horrific experiences suffered by too many. Only prevention can do that.’ Panellists examined evidence from multiple regions where conflict-related sexual and reproductive violence has been weaponised to destroy communities, including against women and girls as well as men and boys – seen, for example, in practices reported in Russian detention centres holding Ukrainian prisoners. Speakers emphasised the ongoing gap between growing legal recognition of these crimes and the insufficient practical, political and prosecutorial responses that follow. Dr Ewelina Ochab, IBAHRI Senior Programme Lawyer and organiser of the Parliamentary session, who leads the IBAHRI’s work on atrocity crimes, including genocide and conflict-related sexual violence, added: ‘Over the years, we have seen some important progress in the understanding of sexual and/or reproductive violence in conflict and atrocity crimes. However, responses are still lagging behind this understanding. We need clear commitments from governments to prioritise the issue and see it matched with proactive responses, including to prevent the crimes, and once they are perpetrated, to ensure justice and accountability for all victims/survivors and comprehensive assistance along the way. The raging impunity sends an unimaginable message that one can get away with such crimes.’ The IBAHRI continues to examine crimes of sexual...",

  "title": "New report ‘No Defence’ exposes systematic assault on lawyers and bar independence in Iran",
  "text": "New report ‘No Defence’ exposes systematic assault on lawyers and bar independence in Iran Thursday 4 December 2025 Download report The International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) together with the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights (CSHR) has released No Defence: A Report on the Status of Lawyers and the Bar Associations in Iran – Challenges and Recommendations (the report) – important new research documenting the escalating, state-driven erosion of the legal profession in Iran. The report presents a comprehensive, evidence-based account of how restrictive laws, political prosecutions, security-agency interference, and gender-based discrimination have converged to strip lawyers of independence, endanger their lives, and weaken fair trial rights for all Iranians. In the report’s preface, Margaret Satterthwaite, UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, underscores both the gravity of the crisis and the courage of those resisting it. ‘Lawyers in Iran continue to practise law, seeking to represent their clients fairly and independently,’ she writes, even as they face ‘threats, harassment, criminal sanctions and even imprisonment.’ Her preface frames the findings as a clear call for principled, sustained international solidarity. Drawing on legal analysis and documented patterns over recent years, No Defence finds that Iran’s legal community is increasingly forced to operate under conditions incompatible with basic international standards. The report details how restrictive laws, political prosecutions, security-agency interference, and institutional capture of bar associations are systematically dismantling the right to defence and hollowing out fair-trial guarantees for all Iranians. ‘The persecution of lawyers in Iran is not a side-effect of repression. It is one of its central tools,’ said Dr Shabnam Moinipour, a human rights expert and Programme Director at CSHR. ‘When independent lawyers are threatened, disbarred, or imprisoned for doing their jobs, the public is left without protection and the courts become instruments of coercion rather than justice. This report shows, in clear and documented terms, that the state is dismantling the last safeguards of accountability by attacking those who stand between citizens and arbitrary power.’ The report documents five interlocking pillars of repression: Institutional capture of bar associations. The report shows decades of judiciary interference in bar elections and governance, including the annulment of Central Bar Association elections, and the entrenchment of state oversight through new bylaws and vetting mechanisms. This has steadily eroded the bar’s ability to self-govern and protect its members. Denial of the right to counsel of choice. The Note to Article 48 of Iran’s Criminal Procedure Code compels defendants in political and national-security cases to choose from a judiciary-approved list, effectively eliminating independent representation in the most sensitive trials. Creation of a parallel, judiciary-controlled ‘bar’. The expansion of the Judiciary Advisors/Centre for Lawyers has hollowed out the autonomy of the independent bar and entrenched state control over licensing, discipline, and legal practice. Escalating violence and repression. The report chronicles a sharp rise in threats, physical attacks, targeted killings, arbitrary arrests, and prosecutions against lawyers, especially those defending protesters, dissidents, or human rights cases. Gender-specific persecution. Female lawyers face compounded...",

  "title": "Gaza stalemate deepens despite UN Resolution",
  "text": "Palestinian children are silhouetted as they stand during sunset in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip, 6 November 2025. REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa A landmark UN resolution on Gaza, while welcome, hasn’t changed facts on the ground. Bombing has resumed, disarmament is frozen and reconstruction is stalled, pushing peace and justice further out of reach. The UN Security Council resolution passed in mid-November gave support to US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan. But political gridlock, a Hamas snub and renewed Israeli strikes quickly froze progress beyond the initial fragile truce. Adopted by 13 members, with China and Russia abstaining, the US-drafted text authorises a so-called International Stabilisation Force to demilitarise Gaza, backs reconstruction and creates a Trump-chaired ‘Board of Peace’ alongside a technocratic administration. Trump called it a major diplomatic win and predicted swift deployment. Arab countries that backed the resolution said the success of the resolution was conditional on securing justice for the Palestinian people by creating a state. ‘Genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinian people, who have waited for decades for the establishment of their independent state,’ said Algerian Ambassador Amar Bendjama during the UN Security Council debate. On 22 November, Israel resumed strikes on Khan Younis and Gaza City, killing at least 24 Palestinians and wounding 54, many of them children. Israel described the operation as retaliation for a ceasefire breach and claimed it was targeting senior Hamas officials. Hamas called it another Israeli violation and urged intervention from international mediators. Since the mid-October truce, Israeli strikes have killed 340 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and WAFA News Agency, and several Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers have been killed. During a press briefing on 21 November, UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires said that since 11 October – when the ceasefire began – at least 67 Palestinian children have been killed in ‘conflict related incidents’, a rate of two a day. ‘Although there’s a ceasefire, people still get killed,’ said Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization representative for Occupied Palestinian Territory. Amar Bendjama Permanent Representative of Algeria to the UN The Israelis say their recent strikes were in legitimate self-defence and solely against Hamas commanders who were re-arming, planning future attacks or rebuilding Hamas rocket capabilities. The violations and trading of blame have created another casualty: the initial optimism that greeted the agreement. Talks on Hamas disarmament, which is Israel’s core demand, and on a new governing authority, which is the main precondition of Arab donors, remain stubbornly deadlocked. Hamas says it will never fully disarm while Israeli forces remain in Gaza or without a clear path to statehood. Under Qatari–Egyptian pressure, the group eventually signalled some openness to a neutral civil administration, but still insists armed resistance is non-negotiable. It denounced the UN resolution as foreign ‘tutelage’ that would turn the stabilisation force into an arm of the occupation. ‘Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and...",

  "text": "US planning for the high-risk raid to apprehend Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, centered on a time when much of the country's military would be on holiday leave, a newly released memo reveals. The December 23 memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel offers fresh details about how the US planned to pull off the daring nighttime raid to capture Maduro in his fortified compound and transport him to New York to stand trial. The former leader has pleaded not guilty to the drug and weapons charges he faces.The raid began late on January 2 and ran into the next day. President Donald Trump said on January 3 that the initial plan was for the operation to occur four days earlier, on December 30, but he decided to wait for better weather. \"The expected duration of the operation within Venezuelan territory is [redacted] hours,\" wrote T. Elliot Gaiser, a US assistant attorney general, wrote in the late December DOJ memo, which looks into the legality of the raid and was made public this week. Much of the planning section is blacked out.\"In order to minimize casualties, the strike will take place at 0100 am (local time) on a date where a maximum number of Venezuelan military would be on leave for the holidays,\" Gaiser wrote.

The US attacked Venezuelan military targets as part of its raid earlier this month. Federico PARRA/AFP via Getty Images It's unclear how many soldiers were away when the US actually executed the operation in January. Dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed, the two countries said after Operation Absolute Resolve concluded.The DOJ memo, which cited Pentagon planning information and details how the US could effectively present the action as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, said that the US expected to encounter \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defenses. That anticipated resistance includes several dozen anti-aircraft systems on the approach to Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas where Maduro and his wife were believed to be and, indeed, were at the time of the operation.The memo outlined how US aircraft would strike air defense systems to clear a path for assault forces to reach Tiuna. It said that the Pentagon aimed to target a local power switching station to keep the power off, which could explain Trump's post-raid remarks that a \"certain expertise\" was used to turn off the lights in Caracas. The US could have also carried out a cyberattack or employed electronic warfare capabilities. \"Kinetic operations will be preceded by non-kinetic action,\" the memo said. More than 150 US aircraft participated in the operation. Eva Marie Uzcategui/REUTERS The...",

  "text": "Tyler Butterworth's only dedicated follower on social media used to be his mom. The Army National Guard sergeant first class said his entire social media footprint amounted to a Facebook account where he occasionally posted photos of his dog. His mom liked them. That was it. About three years later, Butterworth has over 6 million combined followers across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. \"I used social media as a tool to assist me with recruiting,\" he told Business Insider's Jake Gabbard during a visit to Fort Knox in July, shown in the video below. \"It worked very well at getting the information out there.\"John Howell, a major in the Washington Army National Guard, tells a similar story. During his time at a command village in a rural part of Washington, he was tasked with growing the base from 50 soldiers to 132 soldiers, he said. Like Butterworth, Howell took to social media for help. While his following is much smaller than Butterworth's, Howell said the effort paid off. By the time he left the command village, he'd helped grow it to \"triple digits,\" he said.Butterworth and Howell — who don't officially work as recruiters for the Army but continue to post on their personal social media accounts to influence potential enlistees — are part of a growing trend. Recruiters across the military have said that traditional methods, such as phone calls and school visits, are increasingly ineffective, as fewer teenagers are eligible or interested in service, and as young people spend more of their time online, leaving recruiters searching for new ways to reach potential enlistees. Tyler Butterworth recording content for his social media pages while at Fort Knox. Jake Gabbard / Business Insider Despite the shift, certain branches, including the Army and Navy, exceeded recruiting goals in 2025. Military influencers like Butterworth and Howell are part of the new equation, and so are programs like the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which helps interested applicants improve academically or physically to qualify for Basic Training.Still, Business Insider's Kelsey Baker has found that pressure to meet quotas led to burnout concerns for Army recruiters in the past. More recently, Baker reported that those strains, combined with a shrinking recruiting pool, have left many Marine Corps recruiters overworked and burned out. Butterworth and Howell didn't mention feeling overworked due to recruiting quotas. Growing followers on social media, though, didn't come easy to either of them.Adding humor helped them connect with online audiences John Howell got a tip from Butterworth that comedic content works on social media. Jake Gabbard / Business Insider \"My first content was not cool at all,\" Howell said. It was a lot of workout videos that weren't reaching anyone. Butterworth added that he didn't see \"instant success,\" either, and tried many different approaches. What flipped the page for both of them was a shift away from the strong, tough, fearless tone typically associated with the military. \"I think it's important to show that while we are lethal and we...",

  "text": "Russia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow. \"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years. \"Now they lose this amount or more in one month,\" he said of the number of Russian soldiers killed every month. \"So that's also unsustainable on their side.\"Russia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.

Britain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month. Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery rounds at Russian positions on January 1. Marharyta FalGetty Images Russia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\" Russian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.Ukrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media. The casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political...",

По данным Минтруда РФ, в 2024 году в Россию привлекли около 50 тысяч иностранных работников из стран дальнего зарубежья, превысив установленную квоту. Основной причиной стало усиление дефицита рабочей силы в строительстве, промышленности, сельском хозяйстве и горнодобывающей отрасли. Президент кадрового дома Superjob Алексей Захаров отметил, что поток трудовых мигрантов из стран Центральной Азии, включая Узбекистан, заметно сократился и во многом исчерпан. В этой ситуации работодатели вынуждены искать альтернативные источники рабочей силы. Глава Института демографии и миграции Юрий Крупнов подчеркнул, что мигранты из Узбекистана и других постсоветских стран сегодня обладают более сильными диаспорами и лучшей правовой защитой, что делает их менее «дешёвой» рабочей силой по сравнению с выходцами из Бангладеш или Индии. По его словам, бизнес ориентируется прежде всего на минимизацию затрат, а разговоры о религиозных предпочтениях не отражают реальной ситуации. сохраните мое имя, адрес электронной почты и веб-сайт в этом браузере для следующего комментария.",

Vijay was earlier grilled for six hours at the CBI headquarters January 12. He was asked to come again January 13, but the actor sought another date due to Pongal, they said. Also Read Vladimir Putin receives US invitation to join Trump’s Gaza Peace Board: Kremlin 2 hours ago UAE president Al Nahyan arrives in India 2 hours ago The actor turned politician arrived at the agency headquarters on Lodhi Road in a fleet of luxury SUVs at around 10:20 am. He left at about 5 pm, they said. TVK party leader C T Nirmal Kumar, who was present outside the CBI office, told reporters that they are cooperating in the investigation. “Lots of rumours are being spread around which are not true. We all know what happened in Karur. MPs from Delhi had gone to Karur; even the Tamil Nadu BJP president has said what exactly happened in Karur.” “We are cooperating with the investigating agencies. Please refrain from spreading any misinformation. He (Vijay) has not been called again,” Kumar added. Vijay was questioned during the day by a team of officials led by a deputy superintendent rank officer drawn from the agency’s anti-corruption wing, the officials said. Several questions related to decision-making about the rally, reasons for his delay, continuation of the speech, his knowledge about the ongoing chaos, turnout and mismanagement of the crowd were put forth to him, they said. The call on attributing the role of individuals in the chargesheet will be taken only after a thorough analysis of the statements of the actor, senior political officials of his party, and police and district administration officials involved in the process of giving clearance and managing the rally, they said. The federal agency took over the case from an SIT following a Supreme Court order and has been gathering evidence related to the September 27 stampede, which claimed 41 lives and left more than 60 injured in Tamil Nadu’s Karur. In October last year, the apex court had asked the CBI director to appoint a senior officer to take over the investigation and also constituted a supervisory committee headed by former Supreme Court judge Ajay Rastogi to monitor the agency’s investigation. A bench comprising Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria had said the stampede has left an imprint in the minds of citizens throughout the country. It has wide ramifications with respect to the lives of citizens, and enforcing the fundamental rights of the families who lost their kin is of utmost importance, the court had said. “The faith and trust of the general public in the process of investigation must be restored in the criminal justice system, and one way to instil such trust is by ensuring that the investigation in the present case is completely impartial, independent and unbiased,” the bench said.

  "text": "Um ex-funcionário do empresário e lobista Antônio Carlos Camilo Antunes, conhecido como \"Careca do INSS\", disse em depoimento à Polícia Federal que uma filha do senador Weverton Rocha (PDT-MA), vice-líder do governo, viajou em uma aeronave do empresário. Segundo o relato feito à PF no dia 12 de novembro, o encontro teria ocorrido no aeroporto Catarina, no município de São Roque, em São Paulo, em 21 de fevereiro de 2024. O senador Weverton Rocha (PDT-MA), durante evento em São Paulo em 2023 - Ronny Santos/Folhapress Naquele dia, a testemunha e Antunes teriam desembarcado na cidade paulista, partindo de Brasília. O depoente relatou que, após o pouso, o lobista saiu do aeroporto e retornou cerca de duas horas depois, trazendo cinco malas. Em seguida, a mulher, reconhecida pelo depoente como filha do senador, teria aparecido e cumprimentado o empresário. De lá, os três partiram rumo a Brasília. Durante o voo, segundo o ex-funcionário, ela teria comentado que vinha do exterior, dizendo se lembrar de Antunes de uma fazenda em São Luís, no Maranhão. Segundo o depoente, ao chegar à capital federal, duas das cinco malas permaneceram com Antunes, e as outras três seguiram na aeronave apenas com a mulher. O destino final seria São Luís, no Maranhão. A mesma testemunha já havia mencionado ligações de Weverton com Antunes em outros depoimentos à PF. Em 29 de outubro, o ex-funcionário relatou que, após a deflagração da operação Sem Desconto, que investiga desvios de aposentadorias do INSS, Antunes disse estar tranquilo por contar com o apoio do senador Weverton, sem especificar a motivação. Também teria dito que estava \"desmontando o circo\" em conjunto com ele. A menção à filha do senador é mais um relato que liga Weverton ao empresário, apontado como figura central do esquema pela PF. O senador foi alvo de busca em sua casa durante uma fase da operação Sem Desconto, deflagrada no dia 18 de dezembro. Procurada pela reportagem, a assessoria do senador afirmou que o depoimento do homem \"sequer foi considerado pela Procuradoria da República pela absoluta falta de materialidade e conexão com fatos em relação a mim\". \"Reitero que não tenho conexões financeiras com os investigados, assim como ninguém da minha família\", disse o parlamentar, em nota. Já a defesa de Antunes disse que a testemunha não tem qualquer credibilidade e \"extorquiu, furtou e agora se aproveita da situação para inventar mentiras\". Weverton é suspeito de ter sido o beneficiário final e sócio oculto do esquema, por meio de pessoas interpostas, como assessores parlamentares. A polícia apontou também que os principais investigados pelo esquema mantinham vínculos estreitos com agentes políticos, especialmente com Weverton, que seria o sustentáculo político do esquema. Essa relação, segundo a PF, ampliaria a capacidade de influência e blindagem institucional do grupo.

Toffoli cita uma manifestação da PGR que menciona Tanure, dizendo que a PF (Polícia Federal) apontou indícios de que ele é \"sócio oculto do Banco Master, exercendo influência por meio de fundos e estruturas societárias complexas, razão pela qual o bloqueio do seu patrimônio deve ocorrer\". Nelson Tanure, alvo da segunda fase da Operação Compliance Zero, que apura suspeitas de manipulação de mercado e fraudes financeiras - 22.ago.08/ Divulgação Alerj Em sua decisão, o ministro do STF disse que defere os pedidos de sequestro e bloqueio de bens feitos pela PGR, que inclui os de Tanure. \"Diante desse cenário, mostra-se urgente e necessário o deferimento dos pedidos formulados pelo Procurador-Geral da República nestes autos,\" afirmou Toffoli em sua decisão do dia 6 de janeiro. Tanure não comentou a decisão de Toffoli até a publicação desta reportagem. Na quinta-feira (15), o empresário publicou uma nota negando envolvimento societário com o Master. \"Não fui nem sou controlador do extinto Banco Master, tampouco seu sócio, ainda que minoritário, direta ou indiretamente\", afirmou. O empresário foi alvo de busca e apreensão na quarta-feira (14) da segunda fase da Operação Compliance Zero, que mirou pessoas supostamente envolvidas em fraudes realizadas pelo banco Master por meio do uso de fundos de investimento. Ao todo, essa operação envolveu o sequestro e bloqueio de R$ 5,7 bilhões em bens. A operação policial foi uma espécie de ápice na trilha de controvérsias que marcam a trajetória de Tanure desde a década de 1990 —sempre a partir do Rio de Janeiro, para onde se mudou depois de deixar a Bahia, sua terra natal. Entre as empresas nas quais figurou como investidor mais recentemente estão a Prio, do setor de óleo e gás, a incorporadora imobiliária Gafisa, a distribuidora de energia Light, a varejista Dia e a companhia de saúde diagnóstica Alliança Saúde. No passado mais distante, foi acionista relevante da operadora de telefonia Oi no período mais crítico da empresa e assumiu o controle do antigo jornal econômico Gazeta Mercantil em um momento de grave crise que culminou com o encerramento das operações.

  "text": "O gabinete do primeiro-ministro de Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu, afirmou que o premiê foi convidado pelo presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, para fazer parte do Conselho de Paz dedicado à reconstrução da Faixa de Gaza, segundo o jornal israelense Times of Israel. O gabinete ainda não se pronunciou publicamente sobre o assunto. O primeiro-ministro de Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu, observa o presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, durante visita do americano a Israel, em outubro de 2025 - Evelyn Hockstein - 13.out.25/Reuters A criação do conselho faz parte da segunda fase do plano de paz dos EUA para a região. O órgão será presidido pelo próprio Trump, mas os detalhes sobre o seu funcionamento ainda não estão claros. O presidente americano enviou o convite a líderes de diversos países, incluindo o brasileiro Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) e o argentino Javier Milei, além do russo Vladimir Putin. Segundo as agências Bloomberg e AFP, o governo Trump pretende exigir o pagamento de ao menos US$ 1 bilhão dos países que desejem um assento permanente no grupo. As decisões seriam tomadas por maioria, com direito a um voto para cada Estado-membro, mas todas dependeriam da aprovação final do presidente americano. Como mostrou a Folha, auxiliares do governo preparam avaliações sobre a entrada do Brasil no órgão. O plano atraiu críticas de Netanyahu, que disse que o anúncio não foi coordenado com Tel Aviv e que a iniciativa vai na direção oposta à política adotada por seu país.

  "text": "Funcionários da TV Alesp (Assembleia Legislativa de São Paulo) divulgaram um manifesto, na última semana, denunciando atrasos no pagamento de remunerações e do 13º salário, além de incertezas sobre seus empregos, já que a produtora que gerencia a TV encerra seu contrato com a Casa no próximo dia 30. Como noticiado pela Folha, são antigas e recorrentes as reclamações de atrasos no pagamento de salários pela Fundac (Fundação para o Desenvolvimento das Artes e da Comunicação), responsável pela TV Alesp desde 2011. Estúdios e redacão da TV Alesp, na Assembleia Legislativa de São Paulo - Adriano Vizoni - 15.jan.21/Folhapress No entanto, diante de denúncias de que a produtora não tem arcado com as multas rescisórias de contratos em demissões, muitos dos colaboradores da Fundac receiam que a produtora os deixe sem receber seus direitos trabalhistas quando o contrato se encerrar. No manifesto, publicado na quarta-feira (14), eles relatam que 15 dos 120 trabalhadores da TV Alesp não receberam os salários de dezembro. Eles também criticam a incerteza sobre o futuro, sem terem recebido sinalização de possível manutenção dos contratos pela EPTV (Emissoras Pioneiras de Televisão), afiliada da TV Globo no interior paulista que venceu a última licitação para gerir a TV e as redes da Alesp. Funcionários relataram ao Painel que a Fundac enviou um aviso prévio válido entre 6 de janeiro e 6 de fevereiro de 2026. No entanto, o contrato da produtora com a Alesp se encerra no dia 30 de janeiro, gerando apreensão entre os colaboradores, que temem a possibilidade de terem descontados de seus salários os dias não trabalhados. Além disso, uma funcionária disse, sob reserva, que as folgas do recesso de fim de ano foram descontadas do banco de horas, mesmo com a Alesp em recesso legislativo e sem funcionar no período entre o Natal e o Ano Novo. \"Por meio dos sindicatos, temos solicitado informações sobre qual o valor devido pela Alesp à Fundac. Reivindicamos que o repasse à terceirizada seja condicionado ao pagamento de todos os nossos direitos trabalhistas\", alegam os trabalhadores na carta aberta, divulgada pelo Sindicato dos Jornalistas.

  "text": "Usar um carro de aplicativo ou táxi, fazer um lanche fora de casa, ir a uma sorveteria ou a um clube de recreação, comprar uma passagem de avião e reservar uma hospedagem. Todos esses serviços tendem a ser consumidos no verão, em viagens ou outros momentos de lazer, mas essa não é a única semelhança entre eles. Todos também ficaram mais caros no Brasil, com altas de preços superiores a outros serviços ou bens que podem ser demandados ao longo da estação de calor. Nos 12 meses de 2025, o transporte por aplicativo acumulou inflação de 56,08%, segundo o IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo), do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). Lanche fora do domicílio (11,35%), sorvete fora de casa (10,22%) e clube de recreação (10,07%) também registraram altas de preços de dois dígitos no ano passado. Hospedagem (9,61%), táxi (9,46%) e passagem aérea (7,85%) vieram na sequência. Todos esses componentes aceleraram em 2025 –ou seja, tiveram variações de preço acima das verificadas em 2024. Enquanto os serviços pressionam fora do lar, alguns bens industriais encontrados no varejo podem aliviar o bolso do consumidor em casa no verão. É o caso do ar-condicionado (-9,82%), do ventilador (-7,24%) e do refrigerador (-6,79%), que acumularam queda de preços (deflação) nos 12 meses de 2025. Folha Mercado Receba no seu email o que de mais importante acontece na economia; aberta para não assinantes. Carregando... Para Fabio Bentes, economista-chefe da CNC (Confederação Nacional do Comércio de Bens, Serviços e Turismo), os dados estão \"contando uma história\". Se de um lado o mercado de trabalho aquecido ainda estimula o consumo e impacta a inflação de serviços, de outro os juros altos dificultam reajustes de produtos com valor maior, como os eletrodomésticos, diz Bentes. \"O varejo é obrigado a reter preços e sacrificar margens [de lucro], mesmo em um momento de maior demanda sazonal\", afirma o economista. \"Ao consumir um serviço como transporte por aplicativo ou alimentação fora do lar, a gente não depende tanto do crédito, por mais que se pague a conta no cartão\", acrescenta. Moradores e turistas aproveitam praia de Copacabana, na zona sul do Rio; um cardume de peixes aparece no mar - Eduardo Anizelli - 26.dez.25/Folhapress O IPCA é o índice oficial de inflação do Brasil.

A Folha selecionou 40 que podem ter procura aquecida no verão, em viagens ou em casa, além dos itens carnes, frutas e pescados, que reúnem mais de um subitem cada. Se a lista da estação formasse um índice de inflação, a alta acumulada pelos preços seria de 4,51% nos 12 meses de 2025, de acordo com cálculos de André Valério, economista sênior do banco Inter. A taxa é inferior à verificada em 2024 (7,18%). Para Valério, a inflação do verão mostra um comportamento similar ao registrado pelo IPCA de modo geral, que fechou o ano passado em 4,26%, conforme o IBGE. O economista chama a atenção para...",

  "text": "Quem, no começo da década passada, viu o Olodum arrastar multidões no Carnaval de Salvador, conheceu uma música inédita do bloco. \"Várias Queixas\", composta por Afro Jhow, Germano Meneghel e Narcizinho, lançada pelo grupo em 2012, era uma música de batuques e foliões, restrita ao Pelô. Em 2019, o ritmo mudou. Francisco, João e José, que ouviram a letra durante a festa, propuseram uma regravação a Narcizinho, que topou. Surgiu algo mais romântico, um pop com elementos do samba baiano. A ideia funcionou. O trio estourou com a faixa e o grupo, até então tímido no imaginário popular, ganhou força com o nome –os Gilsons. Os Gilsons na divulgação de \"Minha Flor\" - Divulgação O nome é homenagem ao sobrenome em comum que compartilham, Gil, consagrados pelo pai e avô do trio, Gilberto Gil. Quatro anos após o primeiro álbum, lançado em 2022, os Gilsons chegam ao segundo trabalho, o \"Eu Vejo Luz em Maior Proporção do que Eu Vejo a Escuridão\". Os artistas se dizem atentos ao risco de repetir fórmulas, com medo de uma \"síndrome do segundo disco\". \"Ele é mais uma expansão, não necessariamente uma ruptura\", explica João Gil. O álbum é uma expansão do território já conhecido, cavando novas camadas dentro de uma linguagem que o público passou a reconhecer como própria.

Nesse intervalo entre os dois discos, os Gilsons viveram um ciclo intenso de estrada. Turnês pelo Brasil e pelo exterior, apresentações em grandes festivais e participações na turnê \"Tempo Rei\", do patriarca, ajudaram a amadurecer não só a performance, mas também a dinâmica interna do grupo. \"O tempo foi generoso com a gente nesse sentido\", diz João. Embora a ideia de um novo álbum estivesse no horizonte há algum tempo, o projeto só se materializou quando o grupo decidiu interromper a lógica fragmentada de lançamentos e pensar o trabalho como unidade. A partir de um conjunto inicial de canções, o disco passou a existir como um todo. Serão dez faixas ao final, reveladas gradualmente, começando com dois singles lançados nesta segunda (19). Abrir o álbum com parcerias não é exceção, mas método. Entre os convidados estão Caetano Veloso, Moreno Veloso e Tom Veloso, cantando uma música escrita por Arnaldo Antunes. Talvez de maneira inédita, gravar com nomes de peso não assombram os primos. José simplifica que, para além da honra, \"ele é meu padrinho.

A rendőröknek járőrözés közben először azt tűnt fel, hogy a családi házba a friss hóban csak befelé vezettek a lábnyomok. Majd az autóból kiszállva egyértelművé vált, hogy a ház ajtaját feltörték. Azt is tudták, hogy a tulajdonos napok óta nincs otthon. A körzeti megbízottak megtalálták az összekészített holmikat, amikor pedig benéztek az ágy alá, akkor a betörőt is megtalálták. Az Ózdi Rendőrkapitányságra előállított férfi gyanúsítotti kihallgatásán kiderült, hogy még további, általa elkövetett betörések is a rovására írhatók.

  "text": "„Feszült volt a tegnap este, sok játékbeli elem miatt és a saját teljesítményemmel kapcsolatban is maradt bennem hiányérzet. Ugyanakkor egy jó nagy adag büszkeség is van bennem, mert egyetlen csapatnak sem lett volna könnyű tegnap este a szerbek ellen. Ezt tudtuk, készültünk rá, de még így is meg tudtak lepni bennünket. Viszont az a csapat, amely Szerbiában tizenkétezer néző előtt ötgólos hátrányból vissza tud jönni, és támadhat a döntetlenért, az egy igazán belevaló gárda” – nyilatkozta hétfőn, a 15–14-es vereség másnapján a Magyar Távirati Irodának a Ferencváros klasszisa a nemzeti csapat szállásán. „Azt kívánom a többieknek, hogy ez ugyanannyira tüzelje fel őket, mint engem” – tette hozzá a világ- és Európa-bajnok játékos, aki megjegyezte, minél hamarabb le kell zárniuk a vasárnap történteket, hiszen kedden már jön a címvédő spanyolok elleni ütközet, amelynek győztese bejut a négy közé. „Érzelmileg és fizikailag is nehéz volt a tegnapi meccs, valamint az igazságérzetünket is bántotta, és még finoman fogalmaztam. Ettől viszont a világ még nem dőlt össze, mennünk kell tovább, hiszen kedden egy igenis verhető spanyol csapat ellen ugrunk medencébe” – mondta Manhercz. A két együttes az elmúlt évben többször is találkozott egymással, nyáron, a szingapúri világbajnokság csoportkörében és fináléjában is a spanyolok nyertek úgy, hogy a negyedik negyedben kerekedtek a magyarok fölé. „Ezeken a mérkőzéseken az első másodperctől a harmadik negyed végéig bizonyítottuk, hogy mitől verhetőek. Kicsit átalakult a csapatuk, Felipe Perrone kiválásával elvesztettek egy vezetőt. Taktikailag a magyar és a spanyol stílus sokkal közelebb van egymáshoz, mint a szerb és a magyar, nagy iramú meccs lesz, ami viszont már a hatodik az Eb-n, és biztosan nagyon fáradt már mindenki. Hiszem, hogy az a tűz és az egymásért való küzdés, ami minket jellemez, a mi malmunkra hajthatja majd a vizet” – mondta Manhercz, aki szerint rendkívül türelmesnek kell lenniük a spanyolok ellen. A keddi zárófordulóban Varga Zsolt szövetségi kapitány együttesének a négy közé jutáshoz győznie kell a címvédő és világbajnok spanyol csapat ellen.

  "title": "Felmentette a bíróság a gyermekpornográfiával vádolt egykori fideszes alpolgármestert",
  "text": "Hétfőn nem sokkal dél után hirdetett ítéletet F. Tivadar, a budapesti XVII. kerület egykori fideszes alpolgármesterének ügyében a Pesti Központi Kerületi Bíróság. A tárgyalásról már előzetesen tudni lehetett, hogy a nyilvánosságot a téma érzékenysége miatt az ítélet kihirdetése után ki fogja zárni a bíróság, így röviden csak ennyi derült ki a nagyjából tizenöt évvel ezelőtti cselekményekkel kapcsolatban: F. Tivadart felmentette a bíróság gyermekpornográfia bűntette alól, így a több mint 1,8 millió forintos bűnügyi költség az államot terheli.  Az eljáró bíró ezek után kiküldte a hallgatóságot a teremből, így nem derülhetett ki, hogy pontosan milyen bizonyítékok alapján (nem) találták bűnösnek az egykori politikust, tett-e vallomást a bíróságon, illetve hogy a kihirdetett ítélet jogerőre emelkedett-e.  F. Tivadar szabadlábon, ügyvédje társaságában érkezett a bírósági tárgyalóterembe, míg a sértettet a szerettei támogatták a tárgyalóteremben és a bíróság folyosóján.  Az ítélet kihirdetése után röviden annyit mondott az Indexnek, hogy nem szeretne nyilatkozni, még fel kell dolgoznia a történteket. A tárgyalás F. Tivadar ügyébenFotó: Porkoláb Zsófi / Index Szabó József, a Fővárosi Törvényszék szóvivője később úgy tájékoztatta a lapunkat az ítélettel kapcsolatban, hogy bizonyítottság hiányában született a felmentő ítélet. Az indoklás szerint nem lehetett kétséget kizáróan bizonyítani, hogy a felvételek pornográf célzattal készültek, a becsatolt felvételek másolatok voltak, amiket meg is vágtak, valamint azt sem lehetett bizonyítani, hogy F. készítette volna a felvételeket. A Budapesti X. és XVII. Kerületi Ügyészség fellebbezett az ítélet ellen, bűnösség megállapítása és büntetés kiszabása érdekében. A vádirat szerint a vádlott, F. Tivadar 2011-ben a feleségével és az akkor 16 éves nevelt lányával élt együtt a közös, budapesti otthonukban. A férfi ebben az időben a felesége és nevelt lánya tudta és beleegyezése nélkül kis méretű, szabad szemmel nehezen felfedezhető kamerákat szerelt fel a ház több helyiségében részben biztonsági okból, részben pedig azért, hogy megfigyelje a házban történteket. Ennek révén 2011. és 2012. évben a kamerák több olyan pornográf jellegű felvételt is rögzítettek, amelyeken a vádlott akkor még 18. életévét be nem töltött nevelt lánya volt látható. A vádlott a vád szerint ezeket a felvételeket – összesen 97 db kamerafelvételt – egy számítógépes program használatával megvágta, majd az így keletkező videofájlokat külön adathordozón rögzítette. Az illetékes kerületi ügyészség a beszerzett bizonyítékok alapján megállapította, hogy gyermekpornográfia – felvételek tartásával elkövetett – alapeseti bűntette megvalósult, ezért a férfival szemben vádiratot nyújtott be a bíróságra. A kerületi ügyészség indítványozta, hogy a bíróság a férfival szemben büntetővégzéssel börtönbüntetést szabjon ki, amelynek végrehajtását próbaidőre függessze fel. Emellett indítványt tett arra is – a Kúria idén márciusi határozatának is megfelelően –, hogy a bíróság a gyermekpornográf felvételek tartásával vádolt férfit végleges hatállyal tiltsa el minden olyan foglalkozástól, amelynek gyakorlása során 18. életévét be nem töltött személlyel hatalmi vagy befolyási viszonyba kerülhet. Az eltiltásnak nem feltétele, hogy a bűncselekményt a terhelt foglalkozásának felhasználásával kövesse el. Kövesse az Indexet Facebookon is! Követem!",

  "title": "Ötven évvel a kivégzése után mondta ki a bíróság, hogy ártatlan volt",
  "text": "A szöuli bíróság posztumusz felmentette Kang Ülszongot, akit 1976-ban végeztek ki azzal a váddal, miszerint Észak-Koreát támogató politikai szervezetet próbált kiépíteni. Az ügy újratárgyalása során a bírák arra jutottak, nincs elegendő bizonyíték arra, hogy Kang megsértette volna a nemzetbiztonsági törvényt. A férfit a katonai hírszerzés tartóztatta le, majd vallatás közben megkínozták. A hatóságok szerint Phenjan utasítására akarta újjászervezni az Egyesítési Forradalmi Pártot, azt a mozgalmat, amelyet még Kim Ir Szen hívott életre a Koreai-félsziget újraegyesítésének céljával. A szervezet dél-koreai hálózatát a hatvanas évek végén felszámolták, a gyanú azonban tovább élt. Az új eljárás egyik kulcskérdése az volt, hogy az eredeti ítélet bizonyítékként kezelte azt is, hogy Kang Észak-Koreában nyomtatott újságot olvasott. A mostani döntés szerint ez önmagában nem tekinthető államellenes tevékenységnek, és nem alapozhat meg halálos ítéletet. A dél-koreai Szöulban található Szöuli Központi Kerületi BíróságFotó: Bloomberg / Getty Images Hungary „A kár helyrehozhatatlan” A bíróság közleménye szokatlanul őszinte hangvételű volt. Elismerte, hogy bár egy múltbéli hibát sikerült kijavítani, az okozott kár nem hozható helyre. A bírák lelkiismeret-furdalásról beszéltek, és nyilvánosan bocsánatot kértek az elítélt családjától azért, hogy az igazság ilyen későn született meg. Az ügy politikai visszhangot is kiváltott. I Dzsemjong államfő az igazság megkésett helyreállításának nevezte a döntést, és arra figyelmeztetett, hogy hasonló igazságtalanságok nem csak a múltban történtek. Bejegyzésében azt írta: százszor jobb most kijavítani egy tévedést, mint soha, de ez már nem adhat megnyugvást. Nem egyedi eset A mostani felmentés nem példa nélküli. A 20. század történetében több olyan ügy ismert, amikor valakit kivégeztek, majd évtizedekkel később mentettek fel vagy rehabilitáltak. Magyarországon az egyik legismertebb párhuzam Jány Gusztáv esete. A magyar királyi 2. honvéd hadsereg parancsnokát 1947-ben háborús bűntett miatt ítélték halálra, és kivégezték. A rendszerváltozás után, 1993-ban a legfelsőbb bíróság hatályon kívül helyezte a népbírósági ítéletet, kimondva, hogy az eljárás nem felelt meg a tisztességes eljárás követelményeinek, és olyan cselekményekért marasztalták el, amelyeket nem követett el. A felmentés azonban itt is csak részleges lehetett: sem az elveszített élet, sem az okozott szenvedés nem volt jóvátehető.

  "title": "Csányi Sándor nehezen tartható, de annál jobban hangzó ígéretet tett",
  "text": "A szervezetet – akkori nevén a Magyar Labdarúgók Szövetségét – 1901. január 19-én alapították meg a hazai egyesületek képviselői Budapesten, az Akadémia utca 1. szám alatti István Főherceg Szálló különtermében. Az épületnél rendezett hétfői ünnepség után a szövetséget 2010 óta irányító Csányi Sándor emlékeztetett rá, hogy mitől volt különleges az indulás. „Olyan szempontból unikális volt ez a szövetség, hogy a korábbiak valamilyen nagyobb szervezeten, tehát az olimpiai bizottságon vagy más szervezeten belül alakultak meg. A Magyar Labdarúgó-szövetség a kezdetektől fogva önálló volt, fontosnak tartották, hogy önálló szövetségként alapítsák” – mondta a Magyar Távirati Iroda által idézett sportvezető. A saját elnöki szerepvállalására, illetve a kiemelkedő és szomorú történésekre vonatkozó kérdésre azzal kezdte a reagálását, hogy az eltelt idő több mint tíz százalékát ő töltötte az elnöki pozícióban. „Nyilván vannak nagyon szomorú meg nagyon jó napok” – mondta, és kiemelte, hogy a válogatott egymás után háromszor kijutott az Európa-bajnokságra, s az első alkalommal 44 év elteltével sikerült ez neki. „Nagyon nagy eredménynek tartom az angolok ellen elért 4–0-s győzelmet, ami több, mint Puskásék 6:3-as győzelme, mármint különbségben” – utalt a Nemzetek Ligája A divíziójában 2022 júniusában idegenben aratott diadalra. Csányi Sándor MLSZ-elnökFotó: Illyés Tibor / MTI A legszomorúbbnak azt nevezte, hogy nem vehet részt a válogatott a jövő évi világbajnokságon. „Mert azt gondolom, megalapozottan reménykedhettünk abban, hogy legalább a playoffba bejutunk. De rajtunk múlott az is, hogy nem csoportelsőként végeztünk, hiszen három meccset rontottunk el ígéretes helyzetből. Azzal, hogy az írek megverték a portugálokat, az örmények meg az íreket, nagy lehetőségünk lett volna arra, hogy akár az első helyen is zárjuk ezt a csoportot. De ehelyett itthon maradtunk. Négy év múlva ott leszünk” – ígérte. Arra a felvetésre, hogy rövid időn belül a negyedik magyar játékos – ezúttal Tóth Alex – juthat el a Premier League-be, és ez vajon mit árul el a hazai bajnokság színvonaláról, azt mondta, szerinte nemcsak az NB I, hanem az NB II is erősödött. „Erősebb csapatok és jobb meccsek vannak, sokkal több fiatal van a pályán. Nemcsak számban több, hanem azt hiszem, tehetségben is többen vannak, és jobb felkészültséggel bírnak, mint korábban. Ennek lehet az eredménye, hogy egyre többen jutnak ki a topbajnokságokba. Remélem, hogy ez a tendencia folytatódik. Jó lenne, ha a magyar válogatottban legalább hét-nyolc olyan játékos játszana, aki topligában futballozik” – tette hozzá. Lőw Zsolt az évforduló kapcsán úgy fogalmazott, „pici ország vagyunk, de mégis rengeteg olyan apró momentum van a történelmünkben, amire borzasztóan büszkék lehetünk”. „Én meg még büszkébb vagyok rá, hogy mind labdarúgóként, mind szakemberként, edzőként és most már az MLSZ alelnökeként részt vehetek egy ilyen megtisztelő eseményen” – mondta. A korábbi válogatott labdarúgó, aki másodedzőként többek között tevékenykedett a Paris Saint-Germainnél, a Chelsea-nél és a Bayern Münchennél is, emlékeztetett rá, hogy az ő idejében vele együtt többen eljutottak külföldi klubokba – Lisztes Krisztián, Dárdai Pál, Fehér Csaba és Király Gábor nevét említette –, és hangsúlyozta: „ideje volt már, hogy újra legyen egy nagy transzferünk”. „A magyar válogatottnak abszolút érdeke, hogy minél több magyar játékos külföldön, erős bajnokságokban szerepeljen” – szögezte le....",

  "text": "Két ember életét vesztette, és hatan megsebesültek abban a lövöldözésben, amely hétfőn délelőtt tíz óra körül történt az észak-csehországi Chribská kisváros polgármesteri hivatalában – írja az MTI a cseh rendőrségre hivatkozva. Közölték, hogy a részletek egyelőre nem ismeretesek, és az információk is ellentmondóak. A rendőrség első jelentése szerint egy nő halt meg, és négyen sebesültek meg, a legutóbbi frissített közlés viszont azt írja, hogy a lövöldözésben két férfi, köztük a feltételezett támadó is életét vesztette. A Blesk szerint A sebesültek száma hat, köztük egy rendőr és a falu polgármestere, Jan Machac.  A helyszínre több rendőri járőrcsoport és mentőcsoport is érkezett. Patrik Christian Cmorej, a regionális mentők szóvivője szerint a sebesülések súlyosak, és legalább egy nő állapota válságos. A hatóságok a polgármesteri hivatalt és környékét lezárták. „Az épületet ellenőrzésünk alatt tartjuk, további veszély nem fenyeget” – áll a legújabb, délben kiadott rendőrségi tájékoztatóban. A lap információi szerint a fegyver illegálisan volt a támadó tulajdonában, aki a helyszínen öngyilkos lett.  Az elkövetőnek párkapcsolati problémái lehettek. A cseh–német–lengyel hármas határnál, az úgynevezett sluknovi háromszögben fekvő Chribskának mintegy 1300 lakosa van.  W mieście Chřibská w Czechach doszło do strzelaniny w budynku Urzędu Miejskiego.Sprawca nie żyje.

Bár a legfelkészültebbek a vizsgán vagyunk a KRESZ-ből, jó lenne, ha ez a tudás megmaradna a mindennapokra is. Az Autós Nagykoalíció látókörébe kerülő közlekedési szituációknál sok esetben tapasztalják, hogy az autósok nem megfelelően reagálnak akkor, amikor rendőri forgalomirányítással találkoznak egy kereszteződésben – hívta fel a figyelmet népszerű oktatósorozatában az ANK. Pedig a rendőr mindent felülír A közúti forgalomirányításban van egy hierarchia, aminek csúcsán a rendőr áll, de ne szaladjunk ennyire előre, kezdjük inkább az alapoknál. Ha semmilyen közúti jelzés nincs az útkereszteződésben, akkor a jobbról érkezőnek van elsőbbsége, ez a jó öreg „jobbkéz-szabály”. Amennyiben alárendelt útszakaszról érkezünk, akkor „elsőbbségadás kötelező” (macisajt), vagy „állj, elsőbbségadás kötelező” (stop-) táblával találkozunk, ezeknek is megvan a külön szabályrendszerük. Általában a forgalom nagysága vagy az adott kereszteződés geometriája indokolja, hogy jelzőlámpás forgalomirányítást alakítsanak ki a csomópontban. A szabályok itt is egyértelműek – még akkor is, ha naponta látunk videókat a lámpa piros jelzése ellenére áthaladókról… Amikor a lámpa áramszünet, üzemzavar vagy karbantartás miatt nem tudja ellátni feladatát, akkor indokolt a rendőri forgalomirányítás. Kisebb kereszteződésekben egy, a nagyobbakban pedig két rendőr összehangolt munkájára van szükség a forgalom biztonságos irányításához. „Jaj, csak ne én legyek az első!” A rendőrség sok esetben tapasztalja, hogy amikor ők irányítják a forgalmat, akkor sok autós bizonytalan, leginkább a többi autós viselkedéséhez és manővereihez igazodik, mintsem a rendőr utasításait figyeli. Ezért amikor a rendőr megváltoztatja jelzését, ezek a sofőrök nem megfelelően reagálnak, és így megy ez egészen addig, amíg egy autós nem értelmezi helyesen a jelzéseket. Pedig a rendőri forgalomirányítás jelzései annyira egyértelműen vannak koreografálva, hogy egy kicsi odafigyeléssel azonnal egyértelmű lehet mindenkinek. Ráadásul ezek a karjelzések hosszú évtizedek óta nem változtak. Aki mégis bizonytalan, annak talán jól jön egy kis ismétlés. Ismerjük fel a szituációt! Ha egy forgalomirányító lámpa nem működik, akkor első dolgunk legyen, hogy szemünkkel rendőrt keresünk a csomópontban – hangsúlyozza az ANK. Előfordulhat, hogy működő fényjelzések mellett is rendőri irányítás van, például lámpahangolás, vagy delegáció közlekedése miatt. Könnyű lesz megismerni a szituációt, hiszen az egyenruhán felül a forgalomirányító rendőrön minden esetben van láthatósági mellény, kezén jól látható, fehér kesztyű, és egyik karját fehér-piros sávos forgalomirányító bot hosszabbítja meg. A forgalomirányítás elmaradhatatlan rendőri eszköze még a síp is, amellyel a „forgalom iránya változik” jelzést erősíti meg, illetve szabálytalankodás esetén figyelemfelkeltő eszközként használja. „A rendőr hasa és háta piros, a válla zöld” Ez az egyszerű kis rigmus fontos információkat hordoz, sőt rögtön a legfontosabbat. Ha ugyanis a rendőr a közlekedési irányunkra merőlegesen áll, az azt jelenti, hogy számunkra tilos jelzést ad. Ebben az esetben nem haladhatunk be a csomópontba, meg kell állnunk a lámpához felfestett vonalnál. Tehát ha velünk szemben vagy velünk háttal áll a forgalomirányító, akkor STOP. Ha a rendőr vállát látjuk, tehát haladási irányunkkal párhuzamosan áll, akkor a kereszteződésben egyenesen és jobbra, valamint a rendőrt megkerülve balra is lehet továbbhaladni. Ebben az esetben nem ad a forgalomirányító rendőr kiegészítő, a kanyarodást elősegítő karjelzést. Ha a rendőr...",

  "text": "Megszólalt az Ötkert Szórakozóhely Egressy Mátyás eltűnésével kapcsolatban. A szórakozóhely és az üzemeltető Ötkert Kft. közleményében azt írja: megrendülten értesültek a fiatal eltűnéséről, és együttérzésüket fejezik ki a család és a hozzátartozók felé ebben a rendkívül nehéz időszakban. A közlemény szerint az érintett péntek esti eseményeket belső vizsgálat keretében áttekintették, amely során a rendelkezésre álló kamerafelvételeket teljeskörűen visszanézték. Az Ötkert állítása alapján a felvételek azt mutatják, hogy a 18 éves fiatalember önállóan, külső beavatkozás nélkül hagyta el a szórakozóhelyet. Egressy MátyásFotó: Police.hu „Távozása során sem rendkívüli esemény, sem olyan körülmény nem volt észlelhető, amely az Ötkert munkatársai részéről beavatkozást vagy intézkedést tett volna szükségessé” – fogalmaz a közlemény. Az üzemeltető hangsúlyozza: működésük során minden esetben betartják a hatályos jogszabályokat, hatósági előírásokat és biztonsági protokollokat, és az ügyben teljeskörűen együttműködnek az illetékes hatóságokkal. Mint írják, minden kért dokumentumot és információt rendelkezésre bocsátanak annak érdekében, hogy az eset körülményei pontosan és tényszerűen tisztázódjanak. A közlemény kitér arra is, hogy az Ötkert tulajdonosi körében édesapák is vannak, akik nemcsak üzemeltetőként, hanem szülőként is mély empátiával élik meg a történteket. Ugyanakkor arra kérik a közvéleményt, hogy a hivatalos eljárások lezárultáig ne szülessenek megalapozatlan következtetések. A rendőrség továbbra is keresi a fiatalt Ahogy arról az Index is beszámolt, a Budapesti Rendőr-főkapitányság XI. Kerületi Rendőrkapitánysága továbbra is nagy erőkkel keresi a 18 éves Egressy Mátyást, aki 2026. január 17-én hajnalban indult haza egy belvárosi szórakozóhelyről, ám nem érkezett meg XI. kerületi otthonába. A rendőrség közlése szerint az eltűnés kapcsán számos információ és feltételezés jelent meg a sajtóban és a közösségi médiában. Ezeket a hatóságok folyamatosan ellenőrzik, de az eljárás érdekében nem kommentálják. A BRFK ismét arra kérte a lakosságot, hogy az eltűnt fiúról szóló információkat ne a közösségi oldalakon osszák meg, hanem közvetlenül a hatóságoknak jelezzék. A fiatal eltűnése miatt körözési eljárás van folyamatban. Bejelentést a 112-es segélyhívó számon, illetve névtelenül a Telefontanú zöldszámán (06-80-555-111) lehet tenni. Cáfolták a közösségi médiában terjedő híreket Az Index információi szerint a rendőrség birtokába került egy felvétel, amelyen vasárnap reggel a Lánchídról a Dunába esik egy személy. A hatóságok jelenleg vizsgálják, van-e összefüggés az incidens és Egressy Mátyás eltűnése között. A közösségi oldalakon időközben elterjedt az a hír is, hogy a fiatalt megtalálták, ezt azonban sem a rendőrség, sem a család nem erősítette meg. A fiú édesapja vasárnap este a Blikknek nyilatkozva hangsúlyozta: ezek az értesülések nem igazak, fiát továbbra is keresik, és a police.hu oldalán is szerepel az eltűnt személyek között. A rendőrség továbbra is várja a lakosság segítségét Egressy Mátyás felkutatásában. Kövesse az Indexet Facebookon is! Követem!",

  "title": "Tóth Alex átment az orvosi vizsgálatokon, órákon belül bejelenthetik a megszerzését",
  "text": "Ahogyan azt korábban az Indexen is jeleztük, hétfő délelőtt átesett a klubváltásokkor szokásos orvosi vizsgálatokon Tóth Alex. A vasárnap este Bournemouthba repült játékos Fabrizio Romano olasz transzferguru jelentése szerint megfelelt a vizsgálatokon, ezzel pedig az utolsó akadály is elhárult az átigazolás véglegesítése elől.  A labdarúgót a következő órákban akár már be is jelenthetik a Premier League 15. helyén álló Bournemouthnál. A játékos az eddigi információk alapján 12 millió euró (mintegy 4,7 milliárd forint), illetve további 3 millió eurót (1,1 milliárd forint) is elérő bónuszcsomag ellenében hagyja el a Ferencvárost. Az eddigi információk alapján cikkünk megjelenésekor írhatja alá a szerződését a klubnál, amelyben az előző két szezonban válogatottbeli csapattársa, az azóta már Liverpoolba igazolt Kerkez Milos is szerepelt. 🚨🍒 Alex Toth completed his medical and now signs at Bournemouth on a €12m plus add-ons deal.Agreement sealed and signed also with Ferencvaros, club statement next. 🇭🇺 pic.twitter.com/6pPIYCOpAr— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2026 A kilencszeres magyar válogatott játékos ezzel a honi élvonal valaha volt legdrágábban értékesített játékosa lesz: korábban az ugyancsak az FTC által értékesített ifjabb Lisztes Krisztiánért ennek az összegnek mintegy felét (6 millió euró) fizette ki az Eintracht Frankfurt.  Arról, hogy az elmúlt egy évben a Robbie Keane vezette zöld-fehéreknél 51 tétmeccsen négy gólig és tizenöt gólpasszig jutó játékos útja a megállapodásig mennyire kanyargós volt, és még mennyivel kanyargósabb lehetett volna, itt írtunk. Mindent egybevéve Tóth 60 ferencvárosi tétmeccsel a háta mögött érkezik az Egyesült Királyságba. A 20 éves labdarúgó szerződése várhatóan 2031-ig szól majd a Bournemouthnál.  Új együttese hétfő este a Brighton otthonában lép pályára a Premier League 22. fordulójában, emiatt az első kerethez legkorábban kedden csatlakozhat majd a 20 éves futballista, teljes értékű edzésen pedig várhatóan szerdán vehet majd részt új mestere, Andoni Iraola irányítása mellett. Debütálása legjobb esetben a következő hétvégén, épp a Kerkez Milost, Pécsi Ármint és Szoboszlai Dominiket is foglalkoztató címvédő, azaz a Liverpool ellen jöhet össze.  Tóthért a korábbi sajtóhírek szerint Angliából a Newcastle United is érdeklődött, míg Olaszországból a Lazio, Spanyolországból a Real Betis, Németországból a Bayer Leverkusen és az RB Leipzig, Törökországból pedig a Galatasaray figyelmét keltette fel. Az említett csapatok közül a Lazio korábbi ajánlata – amelyet a Ferencváros nem fogadott el – megerősítést is nyert több forrásból. A játékos és menedzsmentje ugyanakkor egyértelműen az angol bajnokságot favorizálta. (Borítókép: Tóth Alex a portugálok elleni vb-selejtezőn.

  "text": "Takaicsi Szanae japán miniszterelnök bejelentette: az idei rendes parlamenti ülésszak pénteki nyitónapján feloszlatja a törvényhozást, és előrehozott választásokat ír ki. A kormányfő ezzel a választók kezébe adja a döntést saját politikai jövőjéről. Hétfői sajtótájékoztatóján Takaicsi elmondta: a választók mondják ki, maradhat-e a miniszterelnöki poszton, és megkapja-e azt a felhatalmazást, amely szükséges a kiadások növeléséhez, az adócsökkentésekhez, valamint egy új biztonsági stratégia végrehajtásához. Utóbbi célja Japán védelmi felkészültségének felgyorsított fejlesztése. A kormánypártok vezetői szerint az előrehozott választásokat várhatóan február 8-án tartják, a hivatalos kampány pedig január 27-én veszi kezdetét. A voksoláson a választók az alsóház mind a 465 képviselőjéről döntenek. Takaicsi, aki mindössze három hónapja, 2025. október 21-én lett Japán első női miniszterelnöke, bízik abban, hogy kormánya jelenlegi népszerűsége elegendő lesz a győzelemhez. Reményei szerint pártja megszerzi a szükséges számú mandátumot, és folytathatja az általa „felelősségteljesnek, ugyanakkor agresszívnek” nevezett pénzügyi politikát. Kövesse az Indexet Facebookon is!

  "text": "Jens Spahn wird wegen seiner verständnisvollen Äußerungen zu Donald Trumps Annexionsplänen für Grönland scharf kritisiert. Der Koalitionspartner SPD wirft dem CDU -Politiker sogar Wohlwollen für den Weg des US-Präsidenten vor. »Wer zwischen den Zeilen liest, erkennt bei Spahn durchaus Sympathien für den Kurs von Donald Trump«, sagte der außenpolitische Sprecher der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion Adis Ahmetović dem »Stern« . »Dieses Verhältnis muss die Union für sich intern klären.« In einem Interview mit der »Süddeutschen Zeitung« hatte Spahn Verständnis für Trumps Griff nach Grönland geäußert. »Wenn man die Lage Grönlands auf dem Globus anschaut, sind die von den USA gestellten Fragen übrigens nachvollziehbar«, sagte Spahn darin. Es gehe darum, Grönland gegen andere Mächte wie Russland zu schützen. »Und ja, da hat Donald Trump einen Punkt.« Ahmetović sieht die SPD hingegen an der Seite von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU): »Wir unterstützen den außenpolitischen Kurs der Bundesregierung, die klare Kante gegen Trumps Erpressungsversuche und stehen weiter solidarisch an der Seite von Dänemark und Grönland.« Bild vergrößern Adis Ahmetović Foto: Friedrich Bungert / SZ Photo / picture alliance In einer gemeinsamen Erklärung Deutschlands mit Dänemark, Finnland, Frankreich, den Niederlanden, Norwegen, Schweden und Großbritannien betonten die acht Länder, »in voller Solidarität an der Seite des Königreichs Dänemark und der Bevölkerung Grönlands« zu stehen. Man sei bereit, in einen Dialog zu treten – allerdings auf Grundlage der Prinzipien der Souveränität und territorialen Integrität. »Wir sind entschlossen, unsere Souveränität zu wahren.« Merz postete ein Statement mit ähnlichem Wortlaut in den sozialen Medien.

  "text": "Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz ( CDU ) hat nach den Zollandrohungen von Donald Trump betont, mit dem US-Präsidenten eine Lösung finden zu wollen. »Wir werden auch in Davos die Möglichkeit haben, darüber zu sprechen. Ich werde versuchen, Präsident Trump am Mittwoch zu treffen«, sagte Merz bei einer Pressekonferenz nach einer Bundesvorstandssitzung der CDU. Ob das Treffen zustande komme, hänge von der Terminplanung des US-Präsidenten und des Kanzlers ab. Merz betonte mehrfach die Bereitschaft zu einer einvernehmlichen Lösung: »Wir sind uns einig, dass wir möglichst jede Eskalation in diesem Streit vermeiden wollen«, sagte der Kanzler. Außerdem stellte der CDU-Parteichef klar, dass die europäische Seite auf die Zollankündigungen besonnen reagieren werde. Man stehe im engen Austausch mit den europäischen Partnern und dem US-Präsidenten. Merz: »Wir können die europäischen Interessen schützen« US-Präsident Donald Trump hatte seinen Besitzanspruch auf Grönland erneut bekräftigt. Er schließt auch einen Einsatz des Militärs nicht aus. Europäische Staaten weisen eine Übernahme der Insel durch die USA zurück und unterstreichen die Souveränität des Landes. Als Reaktion will Trump ab Februar hohe Strafzölle gegen europäische Länder einführen, die sich mit Grönland solidarisieren. Bei möglichen Vergeltungsmaßnahmen wie Gegenzöllen der Europäischen Union setzt der Kanzler auf die eigene Handlungsfähigkeit: »Die amerikanische Regierung weiß, dass wir von unserer Seite aus reagieren könnten. Ich will es nicht, aber wir können die europäischen und auch die deutschen Interessen schützen.« Kanzler betont Souveränität Grönlands Laut Merz würden die neuen Zollpläne der USA die Beziehungen belasten. »Weitere Zollandrohungen werden das transatlantische Verhältnis nicht stärken, sondern schwächen«, sagte er. Auch wirtschaftliche Schäden seien zu erwarten: Zölle würden in der Regel von denen bezahlt, in deren Land die Importe gehen. »In diesem Falle würden die amerikanischen Konsumenten die Zölle bezahlen, aber sie würden natürlich auch unserer Wirtschaft, die Wirtschaft der Europäer und insbesondere der deutschen Wirtschaft, schaden und deswegen wollen wir hier eine Lösung finden«, sagte Merz. Mit Bezug auf Trumps Machtanspruch auf Grönland unterstrich der Bundeskanzler die Prinzipien der Souveränität und territorialen Integrität. »Dänemark und die Bevölkerung Grönlands können auf unsere Unterstützung zählen«, sagte Merz.

Es gebe viele gemeinsame Sicherheitsinteressen mit den USA, etwa mit Blick auf die Ukraine . »Wir brauchen einander, und das sollten wir uns in den Gesprächen immer wieder deutlich machen.« Der US-Präsident hatte wiederholt deutlich gemacht, dass sich die USA die Insel einverleiben wollen – was die europäischen Nato -Partner vehement ablehnen. Trump zufolge würden ansonsten Russland oder China die Insel übernehmen. Grönland ist weitgehend autonom und gehört zum Staatsgebiet des Nato-Mitglieds Dänemark . Aktuell gilt seit Sommer für die meisten EU-Exporte nach Amerika ein Zollsatz von 15 Prozent. Trump hatte unter Verweis auf den Grönlandkonflikt weitere Zölle gegen Deutschland und sieben weitere europäische Länder angekündigt. Die gestaffelten Zölle sollen so lange gelten, bis ein Abkommen über den vollständigen Kauf der Arktisinsel erzielt werde, teilte Trump mit. EU-Kommissionspräsidentin Ursula von der Leyen hatte angekündigt , den »Herausforderungen für unsere europäische Solidarität mit Standhaftigkeit und Entschlossenheit« zu begegnen. Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron will sogar die sogenannte Handels-Bazooka gegen die USA einsetzen : Das »Anti-Coercion Instrument« gilt als schärfstes Schwert der EU in Handelskonflikten.

Gleichzeitig müssten aber Dinge angesprochen werden, die nicht akzeptabel seien. Grünen-Fraktionschefin Katharina Dröge hatte Merz zuvor scharf kritisiert. »Die Strategie des Zurückweichens und der Beschwichtigung von Friedrich Merz ist gescheitert«, sagte sie. »Bei der Verteidigung der internationalen Ordnung braucht es Selbstbewusstsein und Klarheit.« Mit den neuen Drohungen bricht Trump das Handelsabkommen mit der EU.

  "text": "Die Europäische Union prüft Vergeltungsmaßnahmen gegen die USA . Geplant sind Strafzölle in Höhe von 93 Milliarden Euro oder Einschränkungen für amerikanische Unternehmen auf dem europäischen Markt. Die Krise gilt als die schwerste in den transatlantischen Beziehungen seit Jahrzehnten. Zuerst berichtete die »Financial Times«. Hintergrund ist die Drohung von US-Präsident Donald Trump , zusätzliche Zölle gegen Dänemark , Deutschland , Norwegen , Schweden , Frankreich , Großbritannien , die Niederlande und Finnland zu verhängen, falls die USA Grönland nicht kaufen können. EU-Sondergipfel geplant Wie ein EU-Diplomat dem SPIEGEL sagt, seien sich die Mitgliedstaaten bei einem Treffen der ständigen Vertreter in Brüssel einig gewesen, dass eine Einführung solcher Zölle durch die USA zu weit gehen würde und die EU reagieren müsse. Am Sonntagabend hatten sich die EU-Botschafter noch nicht auf die Verhängung neuer Gegenzölle gegen die USA geeinigt. Das Treffen der Botschafter sei jedoch »gut verlaufen«. Der EU-Ratspräsident António Costa will in den kommenden Tagen einen Sondergipfel der EU-Staats- und Regierungschefs einberufen. Dabei solle die Reaktion der EU auf Trumps Zollandrohung erörtert werden, schreibt Costa in einem Eintrag auf der Plattform X. Seine Konsultationen mit den EU-Mitgliedern hätten gezeigt, dass diese sich stark für Dänemark und Grönland einsetzten und bereit seien, sich gegen jede Form von Zwang zu wehren. Dabei seien sie weiterhin bereit, konstruktiv mit den USA zusammenzuarbeiten. Ein EU-Insider sagte gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters , der Gipfel werde wahrscheinlich am Donnerstag stattfinden. Es sei ein persönliches Treffen geplant. Wären Gegenzölle auf US‑Waren die richtige Reaktion? Zur Debatte Handelsabkommen auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben Wenn es keine Einigung mit den USA in der neuesten Runde des Zollstreits wegen Grönland geben sollte, würden die bereits im Juli designierten Gegenstrafzölle im Volumen von 93 Milliarden Euro etwa für US-Bourbon, ‌Flugzeugteile, Sojabohnen und Geflügel automatisch am 6. Februar in Kraft treten, ⁠sagte ‍ein EU-Diplomat der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Die EU hatte die Verhängung dieser Zölle ausgesetzt, nachdem sie sich mit den USA auf ​ein Handelsabkommen geeinigt hatte. Dieses sah eigentlich ‌Zollfreiheit für ⁠US-Waren und einen 15-Prozent-Zoll auf EU-Waren in den USA vor. Das Europäische Parlament hat nach Angaben von EVP-Chef Manfred Weber aber jetzt die nötige und ⁠für Mittwoch vorgesehene Verabschiedung dieses Abkommens auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben.

  "title": "Bundeswehrsoldaten sind wieder abgereist",
  "text": "Ein Erkundungsteam der Bundeswehr ist nach zweitägiger Arbeit wieder aus Grönland abgereist. Die 15 Soldaten und Soldatinnen verließen die Arktisinsel gegen 15 Uhr deutscher Zeit mit einem Zivilflugzeug in Richtung Kopenhagen. vor dem Start sah es kurz so aus, als ob das Wetter den Soldaten einen Strich durch die Rechnung macht, dann aber meldeten sie nach Deutschland, dass es doch losgeht. Laut internen Meldungen der Bundeswehr verlief die Erkundung »planmäßig«, nur eine geplante Station der Reise konnten die Soldaten wegen des Wetters nicht ansteuern. Dennoch, so die Bundeswehr, konnten »wichtige Erkenntnisse« für mögliche Maßnahmen zur Stärkung der Sicherheit im Nordatlantik und in der Arktis erlangt werden. Über den Sonntag gab es diverse Medienmeldungen, die von einem Abzug oder einer verkürzten Reise sprachen. Dies wurde in Bundeswehrkreisen als unzutreffend dargestellt. Ursprünglich habe das Team eine Reise von Donnerstag bis Samstag geplant. Da man schlussendlich gemeinsam mit dänischen Kräften erst am Freitag aufgebrochen war, sei die Erkundung um einen Tag bis Sonntag verlängert worden. Bei dem Trip klärten die Soldaten des Heers, der Marine und der Luftwaffe vor allem logistische Details, wie man die Teilnahme der Bundeswehr an möglichen Übungen auf und rund um Grönland organisieren kann. Diese könnten, so hieß es am Sonntag, mit einzelnen Verbündeten wie Dänemark, Island oder Kanada, aber auch im Nato-Rahmen stattfinden. Die Reise des Erkundungsteams war als Symbol gedacht, dass sich Deutschland stärker bei der Absicherung der Arktisregion engagieren will. Eigentlich als Signal gen Washington geplant, dass man die Sorgen des US-Präsidenten um die Sicherheit rund um Grönland ernst nimmt, entwickelte sich die Entscheidung schnell zum politischen Boomerang. So droht Donald Trump den diversen europäischen Nationen, die Erkundungsteams nach Grönland entsandt haben, mittlerweile mit heftigen Strafzöllen, aus seiner Sicht blockieren sie die Übernahme der Insel durch die USA.",

Die Europäer geben sich entschlossen, den imperialen Gelüsten von US-Präsident Donald Trump etwas entgegenzusetzen. Mit seinem Griff nach Grönland hat Trump aus Sicht vieler in der EU eine rote Linie überschritten. Eine einseitige Verschiebung von Grenzen, ob nun mit Geld oder Gewalt herbeigeführt, möchten sie nicht hinnehmen. Die transatlantische Freundschaft scheint vorbei. Die EU bietet den USA die Stirn. Bild vergrößern EU-Spitzenpolitiker Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz im Oktober: Neue Härte Foto: Olivier Hoslet / EPA Das Europäische Parlament wird, anders als geplant, in dieser Woche nicht dem ausgehandelten EU-Handelsabkommen mit den USA zustimmen. Es sah 15 Prozent Zollsätze für EU-Waren in den USA und Zollfreiheit für US-Waren in der EU vor. Sollte es im neuen Zollstreit keine rasche Einigung geben, würden die bereits im Juli von der EU beschlossenen Gegen-Strafzölle im Umfang von 93 Milliarden Euro etwa für US-Bourbon, ‌Flugzeugteile, Sojabohnen und Geflügel automatisch am ​6. Februar in Kraft treten. Die EU setzte die Verhängung dieser Zölle aus, nachdem sie sich mit Washington auf ein Handelsabkommen geeinigt hatte.

Der US-Präsident hat für Deutschland und sieben weitere Nato-Staaten, die in der vergangenen Woche eine überschaubare Anzahl von Soldaten für eine Erkundungsmission nach Grönland entsandten, Strafzölle angekündigt. Die Zollsätze würden so lange steigen, erklärte Trump, bis die Europäer einem Kauf Grönlands zustimmten ( hier mehr dazu, warum Trump Grönland haben will). Die Europäer haben offenbar verstanden, dass sie mit ihrer Taktik der Unterwürfigkeit bei Trump kaum etwas ausrichten können. Also probieren sie es nun mit Härte. Sie hoffen, dass dies Trump zum Einlenken bewegt, wenn er Mitte der Woche ins schweizerische Davos reist und dort am Rande des Weltwirtschaftsforums mit europäischen Spitzenpolitikern über Grönland spricht. Die Bundesregierung trägt den Kurs der klaren Kante mit, ist dabei aber leiser, zurückhaltender als andere. So verzichtete Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz am Wochenende auf markige Aussagen in Richtung Washington. Und trotz der Kampfansage aus dem Weißen Haus beteuerte sein Außenminister Johann Wadephul, die USA stünden weiterhin »voll und ganz« zur Nato und zur Verteidigung Europas, da gebe es »überhaupt keinen Zweifel« (mehr dazu hier ). Es klang so, als hätte der Minister die Nachrichten vom Wochenende verpasst. Mehr Hintergründe hier: EU plant Gegenzölle im Wert von 93 Milliarden Euro Euro-Retter mit neuer Mission Ob sich die Europäer aus der Abhängigkeit von den USA befreien können, hängt maßgeblich von ihrer ökonomischen Stärke ab (mehr zu dieser Abhängigkeit hier in der SPIEGEL-Titelstory ). Ihr Problem: Die USA, aber auch China sind den Europäern in wichtigen Zukunftsbranchen enteilt. Wie können die Europäer aufschließen?

  "text": "»Europa braucht die Vereinigten Staaten – dann gilt das eben umgekehrt auch. Auch die Vereinigten Staaten brauchen Europa .« Inmitten wachsender Spannungen mit den USA hat Außenminister Johann Wadephul (CDU) im ARD-Magazin »Bericht aus Berlin« für Dialog geworben. Der Zollkonflikt mit den USA belaste nach Einschätzung des Bundesaußenministers nicht den militärischen Zusammenhalt der Nato . »Es gibt überhaupt keinen Zweifel, dass die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika voll und ganz zum Bündnis, zur Nato stehen und auch zur Verteidigung Europas«, sagte der CDU -Politiker im ARD -Interview. »Das hat niemand bisher in Washington in Zweifel gezogen.« In Europa solle man nicht solche Fragen andiskutieren, sondern gemeinsam an einem starken Bündnis arbeiten, fügte er hinzu. US-Präsident Donald Trump hatte im Streit über seine Ansprüche auf Grönland Sonderzölle gegen Deutschland und sieben weitere europäische Nato-Partner angekündigt. Diese begründete er mit den militärischen Aktivitäten Europas, bei denen auch die Bundeswehr beteiligt war. Mehrere Nato-Staaten, darunter Deutschland und Frankreich , hatten Soldaten zu einer multinationalen Erkundungsmission auf die Insel entsandt. Das deutsche Erkundungsteam wurde am Sonntag wieder aus Grönland abgezogen. Europäische Gegenzölle Wadephul erwartet Konsequenzen auf Trumps Sonderzölle: Er sei in der aktuellen Situation skeptisch, ob das vor Monaten ausgehandelte EU-Zollabkommen mit den USA vom Europaparlament ratifiziert werde. »Ich glaube nicht, dass in dieser aktuellen Situation diese Vereinbarung möglich ist«, sagte der Außenminister. Zu einer Frage nach möglichen Gegenzöllen der EU für den Fall, dass Trumps Sonderzölle wie angekündigt zum 1. Februar in Kraft treten, sagte er: Wenn die USA weitere Maßnahmen ergriffen, »dann wird es eine europäische Antwort geben müssen«. Nun werde es intensive Gespräche mit Washington geben. Wenige Stunden später bestätigten EU-Kommissionskreise dem SPIEGEL, dass die EU Gegenzölle in Höhe von 93 Milliarden Euro plant.

Zölle wären »Gift für das transatlantische Verhältnis«. Gefragt, ob es kurzfristig einen außerordentlichen EU-Gipfel geben werde, sagte Wadephul, das könne er jetzt nicht sagen.",

  "title": "Linn ann fordert automatische Behörden-Genehmigungen",
  "text": "Das lange Warten soll ein Ende haben – zumindest in manchen Fällen: CDU -Generalsekretär Carsten Linnemann will die deutsche Verwaltung mit einer radikalen Fristenlösung beschleunigen. »Mehr Tempo schaffen wir, indem wir Genehmigungen vereinfachen«, sagte Linnemann der »Bild am Sonntag«. Wenn ein Bürger oder ein Unternehmer einen Antrag bei einer Behörde stelle, solle er künftig »unmittelbar eine Eingangsbestätigung« erhalten. »Hört er nach drei Monaten keinen Widerspruch, gilt der Antrag automatisch als genehmigt«, schilderte der CDU-Politiker das Konzept. »Damit entlasten wir Bürger und gerade kleine Unternehmen von Bürokratie und schaffen Planungssicherheit«, warb Linnemann. Der Vorstoß soll sich demnach unter anderem auf Baugenehmigungen für Eigenheime, Carports oder Wintergärten sowie auf die Nutzung von Gehwegen für Außengastronomie oder Nachbarschaftsfeste beziehen. »Staat muss schneller werden« Die Idee ist Teil der sogenannten »Mainzer Erklärung«, die der CDU-Bundesvorstand am Montag verabschieden will. »Bürger und Unternehmen müssen entlastet und unser Staat muss schneller werden«, forderte Linnemann. Ursprünglich war die Verabschiedung der »Mainzer Erklärung« mit Beschlüssen zur Belebung der Wirtschaft, zur Reform des Sozialstaats und zur Staatsmodernisierung bereits für das vergangene Wochenende bei einer Vorstandsklausur in Mainz geplant gewesen. Die Bundes-CDU hatte die Klausur jedoch wegen des Wintereinbruchs infolge des Sturmtiefs »Elli« abgesagt.

  "title": "Neue AfD-Jugend in Thüringen tritt mit alt Spitzenpersonal an",
  "text": "Die Thüringer AfD hat einen neuen Jugendverband – setzt aber auf dasselbe Spitzenpersonal wie zuvor, als die Jugendorganisation der Partei unter dem Namen Junge Alternative (JA) firmierte. Carolin Lichtheld wurde bei der Gründungsversammlung in Ilmenau zur Landesvorsitzenden der Organisation »Generation Deutschland« gewählt, wie Landessprecher Stefan Möller mitteilte. Stellvertreter wurde demnach Eric Engelhardt. Engelhardt war bis zur Auflösung der JA im vergangenen Frühjahr erster Landesvorsitzender, Lichtenheld zweite Vorsitzende. Sie sitzt im Kreistag von Schmalkalden-Meiningen. Bei der Gründungsversammlung in Ilmenau waren laut Möller rund 40 Stimmberechtigte anwesend. Neben ihm selbst seien auch Landeschef Björn Höcke , weitere Thüringer Bundestagsabgeordnete sowie der Europaabgeordnete René Aust vor Ort gewesen. Lichtenheld erklärte in einer Mitteilung, dass mit der Gründung ein Schritt zum Aufbau einer »patriotischen Jugendorganisation« erfolgt sei. »Ziel ist es, junge Menschen politisch zu bilden, zu vernetzen und dauerhaft für eine aktive Mitarbeit im Sinne des Programms der Alternative für Deutschland zu gewinnen.« Verfassungssschutz erkennt »weder Mäßigung noch Wandlung« Die Vorgängerorganisation JA hatte sich aufgelöst, nachdem sich die AfD auf Bundesebene von ihr getrennt hatte. Als eigenständiger Verein war die vom Verfassungsschutz als erwiesen rechtsextremistisch eingestufte JA nur lose an die AfD angebunden gewesen. Negative Schlagzeilen fielen somit oft auf die Bundespartei zurück. Als Verein lief die JA auch Gefahr, verboten zu werden, da die rechtliche Hürde hier nicht so hoch ist wie bei einer Partei. Die Nachfolgeorganisation soll nun enger an die Partei gebunden werden. Der AfD-Landesverband in Thüringen wird vom Landesverfassungsschutz ebenfalls als gesichert rechtsextremistisch eingestuft. Thüringens Landesverfassungsschutz-Chef Stephan Kramer hatte schon nach der bundesweiten Gründungsveranstaltung der »Generation Deutschland« im Herbst dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) gesagt, eine erste Sichtung der Beiträge und Auftritte bei der Veranstaltung zeige »weder eine Mäßigung noch eine Distanzierung oder gar Wandlung« gegenüber der Jungen Alternative. Man müsse »wohl doch eher von einer Nachfolgeorganisation, diesmal unter dem Schutz des grundgesetzlichen Parteienprivilegs als Jugendorganisation der AfD, ausgehen«.

  "title": "Cisco’s Journey in AI Workforce Transformation",
  "text": "One thing I hear consistently from business leaders is this: We believe in the promise of AI, but we’re still figuring out how to turn it into real business growth. At Cisco, this is the journey we’re on. Over the past 18 months, we’ve invested in AI tools and learning experiences designed to help people enhance their work and deliver measurable business results. To understand whether those investments are making a difference, the People & Communities team stepped back and asked a bigger question: When AI becomes integral to how our people work, how does it shape engagement, performance, and growth across Cisco—and what does that mean for the business? Over the past year, Cisco’s People Intelligence team examined how employees engage with AI tools, drawing on surveys, interviews, focus groups, and data analysis. The findings send a clear signal: our approach is working—and when paired with a culture that encourages learning, experimentation, and trust, the possibilities for our people and our business are limitless. Key Findings: 1. AI Powers a Better Employee Experience AI is more than a tool—its use positively impacts individual engagement, retention, performance, and growth. AI boosts individual engagement: We’ve seen a powerful, mutually reinforcing cycle emerge: engaged employees actively use AI, and AI use deepens employee engagement. AI users who were interviewed report greater enthusiasm for Cisco’s mission, stronger confidence in our future, and feel more challenged and empowered to grow compared to their peers who don’t use AI. They also report having more opportunities to use their strengths every day. AI strengthens retention: Contrary to claims that AI users are more likely to leave, AI users at Cisco stay longer—and use AI twice as often each month as employees who exit the company. AI enhances productivity and performance: Over 70% of employees surveyed report that AI helps them save time, boost productivity, and handle routine work more efficiently. This enhanced productivity appears to be contributing to performance, as employees who use AI tools more frequently tend to receive slightly higher Individual Performance Factor (IPF) scores. AI accelerates career growth: AI users are more likely to be promoted faster, spend less time in the same grade, and are 40% more likely to be designated Critical to Retain. Those recommended for promotion use AI 50% more often than those who aren’t. These patterns suggest that Cisco is becoming a place where AI skills are not only developed but rewarded. 2. Driving AI Adoption Across Our Workforce Understanding what drives and hinders adoption helps us create the right environment for learning and innovation. Leaders who use AI amplify adoption: Employees whose direct leaders use AI are twice as likely to use it themselves. Top-down modeling truly matters. Even small actions like mentioning AI tools in team meetings or 1:1s create opportunities to introduce practical solutions, build comfort, and normalize AI usage. Flexible work environments support AI usage: Hybrid work and employee autonomy may support more AI usage. Interestingly, employees who choose to come into the office three...",

  "text": "Every few decades, technology doesn’t just evolve—it resets the rules. The internet didn’t simply speed up communication. Mobile didn’t just make it portable. Cloud didn’t just move workloads. Each one re-architected how productivity and possibility are distributed. Artificial intelligence is that kind of shift. But what feels different this time, and what I believe many people are underestimating, is not just the speed of change. It’s how quickly AI is moving from tool to infrastructure, moving from something we experiment with to something that will quietly run everything. Over the last year, I’ve had the same conversation with customers, partners, and our own teams. Everyone feels the momentum, sees the opportunity, and almost everyone is wrestling with the same tension: We know AI is transformative. The question that remains is: How do we choose to shape the AI-powered future? That tension between promise and uncertainty is why we created Cisco AI Summit. Happening virtually on February 3, and hosted by Chuck Robbins, Cisco Chair & CEO, and Jeetu Patel, President and Chief Product Officer, this event is a deliberate gathering of the people shaping the trillion-dollar AI economy and what remains after the headlines fade. We’re bringing together the industry’s most influential minds for thought-provoking discussions: Jensen Huang, Founder, President and CEO, NVIDIA Compute & AI: AI isn’t software alone—it’s manufactured. This is a blunt conversation about why GPUs became the world’s most strategic asset, how intelligence is now produced at industrial scale, and what happens when demand for compute outpaces everything else. Sam Altman, CEO & Co-founder, OpenAI Frontier Models & AI: When intelligence stops being scarce, what breaks first: jobs, institutions, or geopolitics? And what gets rebuilt faster than anyone expects? Marc Andreessen, Co-founder & General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz Venture & AI: No buzzwords—just the power shift. Who wins when AI becomes leverage, and who gets erased by “good enough” intelligence at near-zero cost? Matt Garman, CEO, Amazon Web Services Cloud & AI: AI is turning cloud platforms into the operating system of the global economy. This is a candid conversation on why scale, speed, and control are converging—and why the next generation of power will be provisioned, not installed. Dr. Fei-Fei Li, CEO & Co-Founder, World Labs 3D & AI: AI’s next chapter won’t be decided by capability. It will be decided by trust. How can we ensure that AI values are indeed human values? Lip-Bu Tan, CEO, Intel Silicon & AI: Every AI breakthrough rests on silicon few truly control. This is an unfiltered conversation about why compute is the real bottleneck, how supply chains become strategy, and why the race for intelligence will be won—or lost—at the chip level. Amin Vahdat, Chief Technologist for AI Infrastructure, Google Infrastructure & AI: Models get headlines. Infrastructure decides winners. The essentials of compute, networks, and energy will be the enablers and choke points that will define our AI economy.

  "title": "Cisco’s FY25 Purpose Report: A Letter from Fran Katsoudas",
  "text": "If strategy sets direction, learning is what makes it last. Learning is one of the clearest places where Cisco’s Purpose and business intersect. Ensuring that people are prepared to take part in a digital and AI-enabled economy is essential to sustainable growth, long-term trust, and shared success. When people have the skills to adapt, organizations move faster — with greater resilience and stronger outcomes. Within Cisco, we’ve been intentional about investing in our own capabilities. In fiscal 2025, more than 37,000 employees completed AI-focused learning — a 76% year-over-year increase — strengthening our ability to innovate, redesign work, and deliver value to our customers. As work continues to evolve, learning has become one of the most powerful ways leaders enable the future and drive momentum. For example, at Cisco, employees are twice as likely to use AI when their manager does, and consistent users are more productive and more engaged. At the same time, our commitment to learning has never stopped at our own walls. Through Cisco Networking Academy, we’ve helped more than 28 million learners build the skills needed to participate in the digital economy. And, through Learn with Cisco, we’re supporting the White House’s Pledge to America’s Youth: Investing in AI Education with a commitment to train one million people across the United States. In December, IDC MarketScape recognized Cisco as a Leader in IT Training Services in both Europe1 and North America2. We see that recognition not as a finish line, but as encouragement to move faster — extending the confidence and capability we’re building inside Cisco to our partners, customers, and communities around the world. Learn more about our progress and goals in our FY25 Purpose Report. Millions of Stories: The Impact of Learning A recent conversation powerfully highlighted the importance and impact of education. During a discussion with Equity Bank in Kenya about their learning programs for underserved youth, we realized that one of our Cisco colleagues in the meeting was a graduate of this program. She shared how this bank-sponsored education profoundly changed her life. This personal testimony underscored the real-world impact of Equity Bank’s efforts. As I shared how Cisco Networking Academy builds digital skills at scale, a senior leader from the bank spoke up. He shared that he earned his Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) through Cisco Networking Academy — an experience that launched his career and led him to the executive role he holds today. In a company as far-reaching as Cisco, we don’t always get to hear the individual stories behind our work — but when we do, they bring our impact to life. In the last fiscal year alone, more than five million learners engaged with Cisco Networking Academy, which means millions of stories like these are unfolding around the world. Each one is a reminder that what we do matters — creating pathways for people to participate more fully in the future. Learning in Partnership One important way that we continue to learn as an organization and stay...",

  "text": "近些年来，欧洲“战略自主”（strategic autonomy）引发了很多评论。其中，2021年第4期的《国际安全》(International Security)季刊发表的文章《自主的幻想：如果美国撤军欧洲为何不能保障自身安全？》（下称《自主的幻想》），对欧洲的战略自主特别是欧盟防务能力的自主性提出了质疑。那么，在乌克兰危机仍然持续、欧洲安全格局遭遇严峻挑战的情况下，欧盟能否在安全与防务领域实现“战略自主”？拜登政府上台后欧美关系演化与走向如何？欧洲“战略自主”能走多远？本文拟对上述问题作简要论述。 欧洲安全“离不开”美国 从狭义上讲，“战略自主”是欧盟在安全与防务领域推进一体化的目标，即建设和拥有独立自主的防御能力。但《自主的幻想》一文提出了一个反事实问题，即“如果美国撤军，欧洲能否保障自身安全？”该文认为，过去十年俄罗斯军事实力提升及其进攻性行为导致欧洲安全局势恶化；从奥巴马政府的“重返亚太”到特朗普政府的“北约过时论”加之乌克兰危机的发酵升级，欧盟在自身长期防务投入不足、共同防务建设滞后而且不断遭到美国要求分担安全责任和军费支出的压力等情况下，对美国是否会“抛弃”自己、北约集...",

  "text": "Монгол Улсад цусны хавдартай хүүхдэд цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах эмчилгээг анх удаа амжилттай хийж, дотоодын эрүүл мэндийн салбарт түүхэн шинэ хуудас нээлээ. Энэхүү эмчилгээг Улсын Нэгдүгээр Төв Эмнэлгийн (УНТЭ) Цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах баг Н.Оюундэлгэр ахлагчтайгаар санаачлан, Эх хүүхдийн эрүүл мэндийн үндэсний төв (ЭХЭМҮТ), Бүгд Найрамдах Турк Улсын “Medical Park” эмнэлэг, мөн ТИКА олон улсын байгууллагын дэмжлэгтэйгээр хамтран амжилттай хэрэгжүүлэв. УНТЭ-ийн уг баг өмнө нь цусны хавдартай насанд хүрэгчдийн 36 тохиолдолд цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах эмчилгээг амжилттай хийсэн туршлагатай юм. Эмчилгээний явцад ЭХЭМҮТ-ийн удирдлага, Хүүхдийн цус, хавдрын тасгийн эмч, мэргэжилтнүүд идэвхтэй оролцож, Турк Улсын нэр хүндтэй эмч, мэргэжилтнүүд болох Профессор Тунч, доктор Башак, мөн менежер Сапта нар арга зүй, мэргэжлийн зөвлөгөөг өгч ажиллав.  \"15 настай М охин нь 5 настайдаа цусны хавдраар оношлогдож 9 жил эмчилгээ хийлгэн, өвчин нь удаа дараа сэдэрч байсан бөгөөд цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах эмчилгээний дараа биеийн байдал нь сайжирчээ\"  Эмчилгээ хийлгэсэн 15 настай М охин нь 5 настайдаа цусны хавдраар оношлогдож 9 жил эмчилгээ хийлгэн, өвчин нь удаа дараа сэдэрч байсан бөгөөд цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах эмчилгээний дараа биеийн байдал нь сайжирчээ. Одоогоор тогтвортой байдалтайгаар хяналтын эмчилгээнд хамрагдаж буйг Цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах багийн ахлагч Н.Оюундэлгэр танилцууллаа.  Сүүлийн жилүүдэд цусны хавдрын тохиолдол нэмэгдэх болсон ба жилдээ 150-200 тохиолдол, үүнээс хүүхдийн цусны хорт хавдрын 50-60 орчим тохиолдол оношлогдож байна. Өмнө нь цусны хорт хавдрын оноштой хүүхдүүд гадаадын улс оронд өндөр өртөгтэй эмчилгээ хийлгэх шаардлагатай байдаг байсан нь эдийн засгийн хүнд дарамт учруулдаг байв. Тодруулбал, цусны хавдрын үед үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах эмчилгээг гадаадын улсуудад 350-500 сая төгрөгөөр хийдэг.    ЭМЯ Харин Монгол Улсад анх удаа амжилттай хийж эхэлснээр иргэдийн гадаад руу урсах зардлыг бууруулах, эх орондоо чанартай тусламж үйлчилгээ авах бодит боломж бүрдэж байна. Энэхүү амжилт нь Монголын эрүүл мэндийн салбарын хөгжил, ялангуяа хүүхдийн цус, хавдрын тусламж үйлчилгээний чадавхыг шинэ түвшинд хүргэх чухал алхам болсныг онцолж байна. Турк Улсын “Medical Park” эмнэлгийн багтай хамтран цусны үүдэл эс шилжүүлэн суулгах 3 эмчилгээг хийхээр төвлөсний эхний нь амжилттай болсон бөгөөд дараагийн хүүхдэд эмчилгээ хийхээр бэлтгэл ажлаа хангаж буйг өнөөдөр хэллээ. Мөн Турк Улсад үүдэл эсийн эмчилгээний чиглэлээр эмч мэргэжилтнүүдээ чадавхжуулах зэргээр хамтран ажиллах юм.     Эх сурвалж: ЭМЯ  Анхааруулга Хэвлэл мэдээллийн байгууллагууд (Телевиз, Радио, Social болон Вэб хуудаснууд) манай мэдээллийг аливаа хэлбэрээр бүрэн ба хэсэгчлэн авч ашиглах хориотой ба зөвхөн зөвшилцсөн тохиолдолд эх сурвалжийг (ikon.mn) дурдах замаар ашиглах ёстойг анхаарна уу!",

Үүнтэй холбогдуулан Монголын Хөрөнгийн Биржид 35 жилийн ойн баярын ёслолын арга хэмжээ өнөөдөр зохион байгуулагдлаа. Тус арга хэмжээнд Сангийн яам, Аж Үйлдвэр, Эрдэс баялгийн яам, Төрийн өмчийн бодлого зохицуулалтын газар, Санхүүгийн зохицуулах хороо, Монголын үндэсний худалдаа аж үйлдвэрийн танхим, “Монголын хөрөнгийн бирж” ХК, Үнэт цаасны төвлөрсөн хадгаламжийн төв, Монголын үнэт цаасны арилжаа эрхлэгчдийн холбоо, Санхүү, Эдийн засгийн их сургууль, Голомт банк, Хаан банк, Хас банк, Худалдаа Хөгжлийн банк зэрэг хөрөнгийн зах зээлийн мэргэжлийн оролцогчид болон хамтран ажиллагч байгууллагуудын удирдлагууд, ахмадууд, үе үеийн албан хаагчдын төлөөлөл оролцсон юм. Тэртээх 1991 оны нэгдүгээр сарын 18-ны өдөр Монгол Улсын Засгийн газрын өдрийн 22 тоот тогтоолоор Монгол Улс төвлөрсөн төлөвлөгөөт эдийн засгаас зах зээлийн эдийн засагт шилжих шилжилтийн түүхэн үе шатанд өмч хувьчлалын ажлыг эхлүүлэх, цаашид үнэт цаасны зах зээлийг хөгжүүлэх зорилгоор Монголын хөрөнгийн биржийг үүсгэн байгуулж байсан түүхтэй. Засгийн газрын өмч хувьчлалын бодлогын хүрээнд 475 улсын үйлдвэрийн газрыг хувьцаат компанийн хэлбэрт шилжүүлэн, тэдгээрийн нийт 8.2 тэрбум төгрөгийн үнэлгээ бүхий 96.1 сая ширхэг хувьцааг МХБ-ээр дамжуулан иргэдэд хөрөнгө оруулалтын эрхийн бичгээр эзэмшүүлсний дүнд нийт хүн амын 52 орчим хувь буюу 1.2 сая хүн хувьцаа эзэмшигч болсон гэдэг.

Ингэснээр Монголын Хөрөнгийн Бирж бүс нутгийн хэмжээнд итгэл дээр суурилсан зах зээлийн дэд бүтцийн байгууллага болон төлөвшиж, хөрөнгө оруулагчид Монголыг боломж гэж хардаг байсан бол ирээдүйд сонголт гэж хардаг түвшинд хүрнэ. Салбарт гар бий оролцсон хүн бүрд талархал илэрхийлье. Мөн Уул уурхайн бүтээгдэхүүний биржийн тухай хууль 2022 онд гарснаас хойш биет хэмжээгээр 68 сая тонн бүтээгдэхүүн арилжаалаад байна.

Монголын Хөрөнгийн Бирж нь олон улсын хэмжээнд хөрөнгийн зах зээлийн индексийн тооцоо, судалгааны чиглэлээр тэргүүлэгч Их Британийн FTSE Russell группээс 2022 оны 9-р сарын 29-ний өдөр Монгол Улсын хөрөнгийн зах зээлийг FTSE Russell-ийн “Хөгжиж буй” (Frontier Market) зах зээлийн зэрэглэлийн шалгуурыг бүрэн хангасан тул 2023 оны 9 дүгээр сараас эхлэн тус ангилалд оруулахыг зөвшөөрсөн юм. Төрийн өмчийн хувьчлалын ил тод, нээлттэй байдлаар биржээр дамжуулах боломжийг бий болгон, \"Монголын хөрөнгийн бирж\" ТӨХК нь нийт хувьцааныхаа 34 хувийг олон нийтэд санал болгосон\" гэв. 35 жилийн ойг тохиолдуулан биржийн түүхэн барилгад дурсгалын самбар босголоо Монголын Хөрөнгийн Биржийн барилга нь Улаанбаатар хотын төв хэсгийг шинэчлэн байгуулах төлөвлөгөөний хүрээнд 1948 оны 7 дугаар сарын 8-нд хүүхдийн кино театрын зориулалтаар баригдан...",

Ингээд зогсохгүй шигшээ багийнхаа амжилтыг үнэлж, тамирчдад мөнгөн урамшуулал олгохоо Төрийн тэргүүн амлажээ. Сенегалын шигшээ баг 2021 оноос хойш хоёр дахь удаагаа тивдээ түрүүлж буй. Тэд таван жилийн өмнө Египетийг торгуулийн цохилтоор буулган авснаар анх удаа тивийн аварга болж байв. Ерөнхийлөгч Б.Фай орон нутгийн телевизээр ард түмэндээ хандаж \"Бид талбай дээр жинхэнэ эх оронч эрчүүдийг харлаа. Энэ ялалт бол арслангууд, дасгалжуулагч болон Сенегалын ард түмнийх юм\" гэж онцолжээ. Шигшээ тоглолтын үндсэн цагт шүүгчийн мэдлийн 98 дахь минутад Мароккогийн тоглогч дээр алдаа гаргасан гэж үзсэнээр торгуулийн цохилт заасан нь маргаан дэгдээсэн юм. Сенегалын дасгалжуулагчид бухимдлаа илэрхийлж, тоглогчдоо хувцас солих өрөө рүү дагуулж явснаар тоглолт 15 орчим минут саатахад хүрчээ.  Харин шигшээгийн ахлагч Садио Манэ бусдыгаа ятгаснаар тоглолтоо үргэлжлүүлсэн. Мароккогийн довтлогч Ибрахим Диаз торгуулийн цохилтоо алдсан юм.  Улмаар нэмэлт цагийн 94 дэх минутад Испанийн \"Вильярреал\"-ын хагас хамгаалагч Пап Гейе тоглолтын цор ганц гоол оруулж, багаа хожилд хүргэсэн билээ.   Эх сурвалж: The South African Анхааруулга Хэвлэл мэдээллийн байгууллагууд (Телевиз, Радио, Social болон Вэб хуудаснууд) манай мэдээллийг аливаа хэлбэрээр бүрэн ба хэсэгчлэн авч ашиглах хориотой ба зөвхөн зөвшилцсөн тохиолдолд эх сурвалжийг (ikon.mn) дурдах замаар ашиглах ёстойг анхаарна уу!",

Манай дүүрэгт нийт долоон сургууль нүүрсээр халаалтаа шийддэг байсан. Одоо 117 дугаар сургууль газ руу шилжсэнээр зургаан сургууль үлдлээ.  Өвлийн улиралд энэ сургууль сар бүр 20-30 тонн түлш шатаадаг байсан бол халаалтын систем газ руу шилжиж байна. Бид бүхэн агаарын бохирдлыг бууруулах ажлуудыг сургууль, цэцэрлэгээсээ эхэлж хийх ёстой. Энэ ажлыг хамгийн түрүүнд 117 дугаар сургуулиас хэрэгжүүлж байгаад баяртай байна\" гэв.  Агаарын бохирдлыг бууруулах Үндэсний хорооны Ажлын албаны дарга С.Даваасүрэн \"Улаанбаатар хотод ажиллуулж байгаа уурын зуухнуудыг газ руу шилжүүлэх ажлыг үе шаттай зохион байгуулж байна.  Өнөөдөр Чингэлтэй дүүргийн 117 дугаар сургуульд энэ ажил хэрэгжиж буй. Ирэх долоо хоногт хүүхдүүдийн хичээл эхэлнэ.

Утааг үүсгэж буй гуравхан л асуудал бий.  Айл өрх Уурын зуух Автомашины утаа буюу дандаа хүний хүчин зүйлээс хамааралтай.  Энэ жил утаа буурсан, буураагүй гэж хүмүүс янз янзаар ярьж байна. Бид лабораторийн шинжилгээний дүнд үндэслэж, хэмжилтийнхээ багажид итгэж байгаа. Утааг 100 хувь байхгүй болгоно гэж хэлээгүй. Арванхоёрдугаар сарын эхэнд гаргасан мэдээгээр утаа 23 хувь буурсан хэмжилттэй. Харин одоогийн нөхцөл байдлыг өнгөрсөн жилийнхтэй харьцуулбал 30 орчим хувиар багассан. Утааг алга болгоно гэж хэлээгүй, багасгаж байгаа. Зарим хэвлэлийнхэн \"Энэ багажид чинь итгэхгүй байна\" гэж хэлсэн ч удаатай. Эмч ирж биеийг чинь чагнаж үзээд \"Даралт чинь ихэссэн байна\" гэвэл \"Үгүй ээ, энэ багажид итгэхгүй. Намайг өөр багажаар үз\" гэдэггүй шүү дээ.  Яагаад ус, цаг уурт байгаа багажид итгэхгүй, яагаад суурин станцдаа итгэхгүй байгаа юм бэ. Хэдийгээр үл итгэлцэл бий болж байгаа ч бид утааг бууруулах ажлаа шантрахгүй хийнэ.  Ирэх жилдээ уурын зуухны утааг багасгаж, цаашид орон сууц, дэд бүтэц бүрэн хангагдтал зайлшгүй хагас кокс түлэх л ёстой\" гэв.  \"Gascom\" компанийн төлөөлөл \"Манай компани 2018 онд агаарын бохирдлыг бууруулах хийн шийдэл төслийг эхлүүлсэн. Энэ цагаас хойш өнөөдрийн байдлаар 45 дахь газын хийн халаалтын системийг амжилттай суурилуулаад байна.  Бид өнгөрсөн 5-6 жилийн хугацаанд Япон, Солонгос, Европын өндөр технологиудыг нэвтрүүлсээр ирсэн. Манай компани нийгмийн хариуцлагын хүрээнд өөрийн санхүүжилтээр 25 байгууламжид хийн халаалт нэвтрүүлсэн.

  "text": "डिजिटल डेस्क, नई दिल्ली। मुंबई महानगरपालिका (BMC) में नया मेयर कौन बनेगा इसकी चर्चा जोरों पर है। मुख्यमंत्री देवेंद्र फडणवीस विश्व आर्थिक मंच (WEF) के लिए दावोस रवाना हो चुके हैं। इस वजह से मेयर को लेकर बातचीत फिलहाल ठप पड़ गई है। महायुति गठबंधन की बड़ी जीत के बाद अब महापौर पद को लेकर सस्पेंस बढ़ता जा रहा है। टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया के मुताबिक, महापौर पद की कैटेगरी तय करने के लिए लॉटरी 22 जनवरी को होने वाली है। इस फैसले के बाद ही चुनाव की तारीखें सामने आएंगी और प्रक्रिया जनवरी के आखिर तक खिंच सकती है। लॉटरी से तय होगी महापौर पद की कैटेगरी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, 22 जनवरी को लॉटरी निकाली जाएगी। इसमें यह तय होगा कि महापौर का पद ओपन कैटेगरी का रहेगा या SC/ST, OBC या महिलाओं के लिए आरक्षित होगा। लॉटरी के नतीजे आने के बाद उसी दिन या अगले दिन यानी 23 जनवरी तक आधिकारिक नोटिफिकेशन जारी कर दिया जाएगा। इसके बाद सात दिन का नोटिस देना जरूरी है, इसलिए महापौर चुनाव 29-30 या 30-31 जनवरी को हो सकता है। फिलहाल मुख्यमंत्री फडणवीस दावोस में व्यस्त हैं, इसलिए गठबंधन में भाजपा और शिंदे गुट की शिवसेना के बीच महापौर पद को लेकर बातचीत रुकी हुई है। फडणवीस रविवार को दावोस के लिए रवाना हुए और वे 24 जनवरी को वापस लौटेंगे। उनकी वापसी के बाद ही इस मुद्दे पर अंतिम फैसला होने की उम्मीद है। फडणवीस का दावोस दौरा मुख्यमंत्री देवेंद्र फडणवीस दावोस में विश्व आर्थिक मंच की 56वीं सालाना बैठक में हिस्सा ले रहे हैं। यह बैठक 19 से 23 जनवरी तक चल रही है, जिसमें 130 से ज्यादा देशों के करीब 3,000 नेता शामिल हैं। फडणवीस ने वहां पहुंचते ही मराठी समुदाय से मुलाकात की। वे उद्योग मंत्री उदय सामंत और वरिष्ठ अधिकारियों के साथ हैं। फडणवीस ने कहा कि WEF 2026 महाराष्ट्र को 1 ट्रिलियन डॉलर की अर्थव्यवस्था बनाने में अहम भूमिका निभाएगा। पिछले साल महाराष्ट्र ने 16 लाख करोड़ रुपये के निवेश समझौते किए थे और इस साल और ज्यादा निवेश आकर्षित करने का लक्ष्य है। फोकस विदेशी प्रत्यक्ष निवेश (FDI), रोजगार पैदा करने वाले औद्योगिक प्रोजेक्ट्स और वैश्विक निवेशकों से बातचीत पर है। यह भी पढ़ें: 'मैं संसद में उठाऊंगा दूषित पानी का मुद्दा, आप विधानसभा में मांगे जवाब', MP के नेताओं से बोले राहुल गांधी",

  "text": "डिजिटल डेस्क, नई दिल्ली। भारतीय जनता पार्टी में नए राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष के चुनाव का प्रक्रिया 19 जनवरी यानी सोमवार को शुरू हो गई है। पार्टी के कमान अबतक कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष नितिन नवीन के हाथों में है। पार्टी के अध्यक्ष चुनाव कार्यक्रम के अनुसार नामांकन सोमवार को 2 बजे के बाद शुरू हो जाएगी और इसकी वापसी की प्रक्रिया भी तीन घंटे में पूरी हो जाएगी। बता दें बीजेपी अध्यक्ष का कार्यकाल तीन वर्षों का होता है। हालांकि इस अवधि को संसदीय बोर्ड बढ़ा भी सकता है। इसलिए माना जा रहा है कि सोमवार को ही बीजेपी के नए राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष का नाम तय हो जाएगा, लेकिन इसकी औपचारिक घोषणा मंगलवार यानी 20 जनवरी 2026 का की जाएगी। कैसा होता है बीजेपी का निर्वाचक मंडल? बीजेपी में राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष के चुनाव के लिए निवार्चक मंडल है। इसमें 5708 सदस्य हैं। इस मंडल में देश की राज्यों और केंद्र शासित प्रदेश की संगठनात्मक चुनाव के जरिए चुने सदस्यों को शामिल किया जाता है। इसके अलावा राष्ट्रीय परिषद में भी 35 सदस्य शामिल होते हैं। इसमें नरेंद्र मोदी, अमित शाह, राजनाथ सिंह और जेपी नड्डा भी शामिल है। गौरतलब है कि बीजेपी में स्थापना से लेकर अबतक 11 राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष बनाए गए हैं। हालांकि अब तक किसी भी अध्यक्ष के लिए मतदान की नौबत नहीं आई है। यानी सभी अध्यक्ष निर्विरोध चुने गए हैं। साल 2019 में पार्टी में कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष पद का सृजन हुआ। इसी पद पर अब नितिन नवीन हैं। अब तक कौन-कौन रहे बीजेपी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष? 'अंधेरा छटेगा, सूरज निकलेगा, कमल खिलेगा' 1980 में जनसंघ के बाद उभरी भाजपा में 11 राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष बे और सभी निर्विरोध चुने गए। आपातकाल के बाद की राजनीतिक उथल-पुथल में अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी, लाल कृष्ण आडवाणी, मुरली मनोहर जोशी, नानाजी देशमुख, के.आर. मल्कानी, सिकंदर बख्त, विजय कुमार मल्होत्रा, विजयराजे सिंधिया, भैरौं सिंह शेखावत, शांता कुमार, राम जेठमलानी और जगन्नाथराव जोशी ने भाजपा की नींव रखी थी। तब जनता पार्टी का प्रयोग विफल हो चुका था और वाजपेयी ने पार्टी को एक उदार हिंदुत्व वाली राष्ट्रीय शक्ति बनाने का सपना देखा था। उनका कार्यकाल (1980-1986) पार्टी की आधारशिला था। पार्टी की पहले अधिवेशन में अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी ने भाषण दिया, \"अंधेरा छटेगा, सूरज निकलेगा, कमल खिलेगा।\" लेखक विनय सीतापति ने अपनी किताब 'जुगलबंदी: द बीजेपी विफोर मोदी' में बताया है कि कैसे अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी की काव्यात्मक शैली ने बीजेपी को आरएसएस के समांतर रखते हुए पार्टी को आगे बढ़ाया। किताब में वाजपेयी को 'उदार योद्धा' कहा गया है। फोटो सोर्स- पेंगुइन पब्लिकेशन जिन्ना को 'धर्मनिरपेक्ष' कहने पर आडवाणी को देना पड़ा था इस्तीफा अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी के बाद बीजेपी की कमान लाल कृष्ण आडवाणी ने संभाली। लाल कृष्ण आडवाणी तीन बार (1986-1990, 1993-1998, 2004-2005) पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष बने। आडवाणी को पार्टी को हिंदुत्व की मुख्यधारा में लाने का श्रेय दिया जाता है। उनका पहला कार्यकाल उत्तर भारत में आधार मजबूत करने का था। साल 1990 की राम रथ यात्रा के दौरान आडवाणी की राजनीति का लोहा देश भर में माना जाने लगा था। यह यात्रा सोमनाथ से अयोध्या तक थी। इस दौरान...",

  "text": "डिजिटल डेस्क, नई दिल्ली। बिहार के युवा नेता और पूर्व मंत्री नितिन नवीन ने बीजेपी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष पद के लिए अपना नामांकन दाखिल कर दिया है। इस दौरान बीजेपी के प्रमुख नेता अमित शाह, राजनाथ सिंह, नितिन गडकरी और जेपी नड्डा मौजूद रहे। बीजेपी नेशनल प्रेसिडेंट के पद के लिए नॉमिनेशन प्रोसेस पार्टी हेडक्वार्टर में चल रहा है। अगले 24 घंटे में छत्तीसगढ़ के सीएम विष्णु देव साय और छत्तीसगढ़ बीजेपी नेताओं ने अपना सपोर्ट लेटर जमा किया। नितिन नवीन की नामांकन प्रक्रिया के दौरान जेपी नड्डा, हरदीप पुरी, यूपी के सीएम योगी आदित्यनाथ, छत्तीसगढ़ के सीएम विष्णु देव साय, राज्य इकाइयों के अध्यक्ष, सांसद और अन्य पदाधिकारी मौजूद रहें। निर्विरोध चुनाव की संभावना बताया जा रहा है कि कल यानी 20 जनवरी को भाजपा के नए राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष की औपचारिक घोषणा होने की संभावना है। पार्टी सूत्रों के अनुसार, राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष पद के लिए नितिन नवीन ही एकमात्र उम्मीदवार होंगे। ऐसे में उनका निर्विरोध चुना जाना लगभग तय माना जा रहा है। कैसे होता है भाजपा अध्यक्ष का चुनाव? भारतीय जनता पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष का चुनाव पार्टी की राष्ट्रीय परिषद और राज्य परिषदों के प्रतिनिधियों से मिलकर बने निर्वाचक मंडल द्वारा किया जाता है। इस पूरे प्रकिया की देखरेख पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय प्रतिवेदक द्वारा की जाती है। किसी राज्य के निर्वाचक मंडल के कोई भी 20 सदस्य संयुक्त रूप से राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष पद के लिए ऐसे व्यक्ति का नाम प्रस्तावित कर सकते हैं जो चार कार्यकाल तक पार्टी का सक्रिय सदस्य रहा हो और उससकी सदस्यता के 15 साल हो चुके हों। लेकिन ऐसा संयुक्त प्रस्ताव कम-से-कम पांच ऐसे राज्यों से आना चाहिए, जहां राष्ट्रीय परिषद के लिए चुनाव हो चुके हों। यह भी पढ़ें- नितिन नवीन का निर्विरोध भाजपा अध्यक्ष चुना जाना तय, सिर्फ औपचारिकता बाकी; इस दिन होगी घोषणा यह भी पढ़ें- बिहार से भाजपा की नई कमान: नितिन नवीन की ताजपोशी, इतिहास और भविष्य दोनों बदलने वाला दिन; ये है पूरा कार्यक्रम",

  "text": "डिजिटल डेस्क, नई दिल्ली। महाराष्ट्र के भिवंडी-निजामपुर महानगरपालिका चुनाव के नतीजे आने के बाद रविवार को बड़ा बवाल हो गया। भाजपा विधायक महेश चोघुले और कोनार्क विकास अघाड़ी (KVA) के नेता और पूर्व महापौर विलास पाटिल के समर्थकों के बीच चतपति शिवाजी महाराज चौक के पास जोरदार झड़प हुई। इसमें पथराव भी हुआ, जिससे इलाके में तनाव पसर गया। थाने सिटी पुलिस कमिश्नरेट ने बताया कि अब स्थिति नियंत्रण में है। दोनों पक्षों के बीच पुरानी रंजिश यह झड़प चुनावी हार-जीत की वजह से भड़की है। KVA के नेता विलास पाटिल का परिवार भिवंडी की स्थानीय राजनीति में लंबे समय से मजबूत पकड़ रखता है। इस बार भी उनके परिवार ने खासकर वॉर्ड नंबर 1 में बड़ी जीत दर्ज की, जहां विलास पाटिल के बेटे एडवोकेट मयूरेश पाटिल ने भाजपा विधायक महेश चोघुले के बेटे मीट चोघुले को हराया है। यह जीत काफी करीबी रही है। पुलिस ने क्या कहा? ठाणे के डीसीपी जोन-2 शशिकांत बोराटे ने कहा, \"दो नेताओं के समर्थकों के बीच झड़प हुई। पुलिस ने तुरंत हस्तक्षेप किया और दोनों पक्षों के कार्यकर्ताओं को तितर-बितर कर दिया। फिलहाल स्थिति पूरी तरह नियंत्रण में है।\" भाजपा विधायक महेश चोघुले ने कहा, \"चुनाव खत्म हो चुके हैं। कल भी उन्होंने कुछ गरीब बच्चों पर हमला किया था। आज शाम करीब 5 बजे दो बच्चों को पीटा गया, फिर मेरे दफ्तर पर पथराव हुआ। पुलिस और मेरे समर्थकों पर भी हमला किया गया। मैं पुलिस का शुक्रिया अदा करता हूं कि उन्होंने पूरे हालात को संभाला। विलास पाटिल चाहते हैं कि उनका इलाका कोई छुए नहीं। हम पुलिस स्टेशन पहुंचे हैं और देखेंगे कि पुलिस क्या कार्रवाई करती है।\" चुनावी नतीजों में बदला समीकरण भिवंडी-निजामपुर महानगरपालिका में कुल 90 सीटें हैं। चुनाव परिणामों के अनुसार कांग्रेस सबसे बड़ी पार्टी बनकर उभरी है, जिसने 30 सीटें जीतीं। भाजपा को 22 सीटें मिलीं, जबकि शिवसेना (शिंदे गुट) और NCP (शरद पवार गुट) को 12-12 सीटें हासिल हुईं। KVA ने 4 सीटें जीतीं हैं। (समाचार एजेंसी ANI इनपुट के साथ) ये भी पढ़ें: 'मैं संसद में उठाऊंगा दूषित पानी का मुद्दा, आप विधानसभा में मांगे जवाब', MP के नेताओं से बोले राहुल गांधी",

  "text": "迎戰2026年縣市長選舉，各黨初選與協調作業正如火如荼展開。針對台北市選戰布局，國民黨台北市議員詹為元18日於《 大新聞大爆卦 》節目中分析指出，民進黨長期未深耕台北市，導致至今仍難以推出具說服力的市長人選。 詹為元表示，民進黨過去並未著力培養台北市在地政治人才，即便曾有立委被點名或表態參選，仍認為難以符合市民期待。他指出，「畢竟台北市是首都，首都其實很多事情，跟很多產業洞見相關。所以當然會期待，有一些有國際視野、有產業視野，甚至有行政經驗的人，願意下來選台北市市長。」在目前綠營被點名的人選中，他認為行政院長卓榮泰與行政院副院長鄭麗君，相對而言「比較像一回事」。 不過，詹為元進一步分析，卓榮泰過去一年在政治作為上「不管所謂權力制衡，把立法院跟行政院搞得烏煙瘴氣」，已逐漸消耗其過去「中性、溫和、可溝通」的形象。他直言，「（卓榮泰）現在轉跳進來說要去選臺北市市長，我相信其實臺北市民也不會買單。」 至於鄭麗君，詹為元認為，從整體社會反應來看，無論藍營或綠營內部，對其談判成果的評價皆未如官方宣傳般一致，「不要說藍營，我在綠營也沒看到他們對鄭麗君有多少讚揚。」他指出，政府過度強調表面成果，卻未誠...",

  "text": "​ 民進黨 2026大選台南、高雄人選已先後出爐，其中台南市「非賴系」立委 陳亭妃 的出線，掀起各界對於總統 賴清德 「德意志」的討論； 國民黨 前發言人、台北市松信區議員參選人 李明璇 直言，國民黨立委 謝龍介 要想勝出，突破點不在陳亭妃本人，而是轉化台南鄉親對賴清德、新潮流的不滿。 李明璇在《新聞大白話》節目中指出，完全不用過度討論綠營在台南的整合力道，因為賴清德「丟不起台南」，畢竟除了是本命區之外，一旦台南失守，賴清德在2028年更會被貼上「本命區翻車」的標籤。 「賴清德一定會（盡全力）保住台南」，李明璇認為，陳亭妃之所以被選中，可以看出台南市民對民進黨是非常反感的；李明璇進一步解釋，陳亭妃之所以能降低反感值，「非新潮流」是關鍵之一，再來就是對台南人來說，至少她（陳亭妃）不是民進黨中央硬塞的人選。 李明璇直言，陳亭妃確定出線後，現任市長黃偉哲、賴清德一定會全力輔選，因為兩人都在為了更高的政治舞台鋪路，至於會不會「100%真心」，李明璇也明確給予否定的答案。 （相關報導： 柯文哲笑蔣萬安騙選票！黃揚明憶「藍白合破局關鍵」：這事只會不斷發生 ｜ 更多文章 ） 話鋒一轉，李明璇表示，對...",

  "text": "民進黨日前已陸續完成高雄、台南、嘉義等地區的縣市首長黨內初選，並預計於21日中執會正式通過提名，提前布局2026年縣市暨直轄市長選舉。針對新北市選戰，國民黨立法委員洪孟楷18日於《 大新聞大爆卦 》節目中指出，民進黨立委蘇巧慧在2024年立委選後，便已頻繁跨區走訪新北市，極可能代表綠營出線。反觀藍營方面，目前仍有台北市副市長李四川、新北市副市長劉和然等人角逐，民眾黨主席黃國昌亦表達參選意願，洪孟楷認為，藍營內部應加快提名腳步。 洪孟楷強調，「民進黨已經擺好陣仗了。」他表示，過去兩年間，蘇巧慧多次運用民進黨黨部資源跨區走動，並參與罷免站台；相較之下，藍營至今仍在評估新北市長潛在人選，「藍白什麼時候會整合，我覺得這是大家所關心的。」 洪孟楷表示，他已多次向黨中央建議，2026年縣市長選舉應建立全國一致的提名機制，「我們應該先把遊戲規則講清楚，講完之後，各縣市就依照規則走，這樣比較能避免『因人設事』的狀況。」他認為，若制度不一，容易演變成 「大家光討論哪一個遊戲規則對誰比較有利」 ，反而造成內耗。他也指出， 「包括宜蘭縣、嘉義市、新北市，都有藍白要整合的問題」 ，因此國民黨應盡快定於一尊。 ...",

  "text": "CENTRAL ILLINOIS ( 25News Now ) - First Alert Weather Day continues for central Illinois as a blast of arctic air moves in overnight, bringing dangerously cold wind chills by Monday morning. A Cold Weather Advisory is in effect through noon Monday, with strong northwest winds behind the fast-moving arctic front pushing wind chills down to -15 to -25 below zero, making it dangerous to be outside for any length of time. Dangerous wind chills expected Monday morning. Limit your time outdoors! (First Alert Forecast) Wind chills as low as -15 to -25 below zero. (First Alert Forecast) Ahead of the front, light snow or flurries are possible tonight, mainly north of I-74. Most areas will see only a few flakes or a dusting, but north-central Illinois could pick up around half an inch. South of I-74, little to no snow accumulation is expected. The arctic front will move through late this evening into the overnight hours, causing temperatures to drop into the single digits, with some spots near zero. Winds will turn northwest at 15–25 mph, with gusts up to 35 mph, increasing the danger of extremely low wind chills. By Monday morning, wind chills across central Illinois will feel -15 to -25 below zero, making it extremely important to limit time outdoors as frostbite could occur withing 30 minutes. Gusty 30-35 mph winds expected behind arctic front. (First Alert Forecast) Monday will be mostly sunny, but the sunshine will offer little relief from the cold. Highs are expected in the mid-teens, with wind chills remaining below zero through much of the morning. Winds will gradually ease during the afternoon, allowing wind chills to improve slightly, but the cold will remain dangerous throughout the day. Layer up, limit time outdoors, and keep pets and pipes protected as the region is in for a serious chill. (First Alert Forecast) A brief warm-up is possible midweek, with Tuesday highs in the upper 20s to low 30s and Wednesday highs in the 30s to low 40s, but another surge of arctic air could be expected later in the week and over the weekend. Reminder to bundle up, limit time outdoors, and take precautions as the dangerous cold settles in. Frostbite can occur withing 30 minutes with the dangerous wind chills Monday morning.

  "title": "Europe warns of ‘dangerous downward spiral’ after Trump threatens tariffs over Greenland",
  "text": "BERLIN (AP) — The eight European countries targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump for a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland blasted the move Sunday, warning that his threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” The joint statement by some of America’s closest allies signaled a possible turning point in the recent tensions over sovereignty and security nearly 24 hours after Trump’s threat. It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and flattery around him, even when seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. Sunday’s statement, as well as some European countries sending troops to Greenland for a Danish military training exercise, appeared to be a step away from that strategy. The unusually strong joint statement from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland said troops sent to Greenland for operation “Arctic Endurance” pose “no threat to anyone.” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told reporters in Oslo that a dialogue was opened with the U.S. last week and “we will not give up on that. ... So we will stay on track — unless U.S. decides differently.\" Added Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide at the same news conference: “We will not allow ourselves to be put under pressure, and those types of threats (of U.S. tariffs) are unacceptable between close allies,” Six of the countries targeted are part of the 27-member European Union, which operates as a single economic zone in terms of trade. Following emergency talks among the EU’s national envoys Sunday, EU Council President Antonio Costa said the bloc’s leaders agree “that tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and are incompatible with the EU-U.S. trade agreement.” They expressed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion,” Costa said in a statement. He is expected to convene a summit of the bloc’s leaders later this week. Solidarity with Denmark and Greenland Trump’s Saturday announcement sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. He appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security. “We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland,” the group said. “Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” There are immediate questions about how the White House could implement tariffs against the EU. It was unclear, too, how Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a U.S. Supreme Court challenge. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and...",

  "title": "Army puts 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible Minnesota deployment, AP sources say",
  "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to be ready in case of a possible deployment to Minnesota, where federal authorities have been conducting a massive immigration enforcement operation, two defense officials said Sunday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military plans, said two infantry battalions of the Army’s 11th Airborne Division have been given prepare-to-deploy orders. The unit is based in Alaska and specializes in operating in arctic conditions. One defense official said the troops are standing by to deploy to Minnesota should President Donald Trump invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely-used 19th century law that would allow him to employ active duty troops as law enforcement. The move comes just days after Trump threatened to do just that to quell protests against his administration’s immigration crackdown. In an emailed statement, Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell did not deny the orders were issued and said the military “is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon.” ABC News was the first to report the development. On Thursday, Trump said in a social media post that he would invoke the 1807 law “if the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job.” He appeared to walk back the threat a day later, telling reporters at the White House that there wasn’t a reason to use it “right now.” “If I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump said. “It’s very powerful.” Trump has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act throughout both of his terms. In 2020 he also threatened to use it to quell protests after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, and in recent months he threatened to use it for immigration protests. The law was most recently invoked by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 to end unrest in Los Angeles after the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and frequent target of Trump, has urged the president to refrain from sending in more troops. “I’m making a direct appeal to the President: Let’s turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,” Walz said last week on social media. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

  "title": "PAC supporting Stratton’s Senate candidacy launches long-awaited ad",
  "text": "Article Summary A new 30-second TV and digital ad highlights Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton’s status as Gov. JB Pritzker’s governing partner and casts her as someone who will “take the fight to Washington to pass ‘Medicare for all’ and tax the rich.” But the ad had to be updated after Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi’s campaign noted it appeared to violate federal campaign finance law by failing to disclose that it was not authorized by Stratton or her campaign. Outside PAC spending is viewed as one of the only ways for Stratton to compete with Krishnamoorthi, whose robust war chest has allowed him to air television ads nonstop since last July. This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. SPRINGFIELD ( 25News Now ) - Lt. Gov Juliana Stratton’s struggling U.S. Senate campaign finally received some long-awaited air support from an outside political action committee with ties to Gov. JB Pritzker — though a lapse in federal disclosure requirements briefly grounded the effort. Illinois Future PAC, established last year to support Stratton’s candidacy, launched its first ad on Friday. The 30-second spot highlights Stratton’s status as Pritzker’s governing partner and casts her as someone who will “take the fight to Washington to pass ‘Medicare for all’ and tax the rich.” The “seven-figure” buy will run on television and digital platforms. But within hours of its launch, the PAC had to update the ad after Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi’s campaign noted it appeared to violate federal campaign finance law by failing to disclose that it was not authorized by Stratton or her campaign. The ad also did not display a street address, phone number, or website for the PAC, as required by law. Krishnamoorthi’s campaign also highlighted similarities between the fonts used by the PAC and Stratton’s campaign, suggesting that the ad could mislead voters into believing there to be an official relationship between the two. While PACs may raise unlimited sums from corporations, unions, associations and individuals to advocate for or against a specific candidate, they cannot coordinate directly with a candidate’s campaign. In a letter to television stations, Krishnamoorthi’s campaign said they “had an obligation to cease airing this",

Attendees can see large boats, fishing boats and RVs along with boat lifts, hot tubs, truck accessories, baked goods and services from Central Illinois businesses. Organizers say they are expecting more than four thousand people. “They’re not just on display, there’s people from the manufacturers and from the dealers that will talk to you,” said Andy Knapp, Chief Revenue Officer of Events Inc. “A lot of people think, that sounds like something they’d want to do, but they don’t know or it’s just been a dream. Well, you can come find out if it’s just a dream or something you’d really want to be involved in.” Knapp continued. The last chance to see the show is Sunday, Jan. 18 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with tickets available at the door. The cost is $6 for the general public and $4 for seniors and veterans.

Trong khoảng một năm trở lại đây, cuộc đua không còn nằm ở khía cạnh màn hình, hiệu suất hay camera.Thay vào đó, xu hướng được nhiều hãng di động thúc đẩy là gia tăng độ bền, không chỉ về thiết kế mà còn bền bỉ ở thời lượng sử dụng pin. Phân khúc này tập trung vào nhóm người dùng “ăn chắc mặc bền”, cần một chiếc điện thoại có thể sử dụng ổn định trong nhiều năm.Để đáp ứng yêu cầu trên, vivo Y31d không đi theo xu hướng thiết kế mỏng nhẹ như nhiều smartphone trên thị trường. Nhà sản xuất tập trung gia cố vật liệu cấu thành thiết bị. Máy có kích thước 8,39mm cùng trọng lượng 219g, mang đến cảm giác cầm nắm chắc chắn và ôm tay.Mẫu máy này thuộc nhóm smartphone có độ bền cao nhất trong phân khúc di động phổ thông. Thiết bị đạt chứng nhận chống rơi vỡ 5 sao từ SGS và độ bền chuẩn quân đội, có khả năng chống chịu trước các va chạm ngoài ý muốn như rơi khỏi bàn, va đập trong balo hay trượt tay khi di chuyển.vivo Y31d cũng trải qua hàng loạt bài kiểm tra độ bền vật lý, bao gồm thử nghiệm rơi lặp lại nhiều lần, chịu lực tác động lớn và va đập trong điều kiện không sử dụng ốp lưng, nhằm mô phỏng những rủi ro thường gặp trong quá trình sử dụng hàng ngày.Thiết bị còn có khả năng chống cong khi chịu lực tác động lên đến 50kg hay có thể chịu được xe tải cán qua với trọng lượng hơn 2.000kg. Máy đạt đồng thời các chuẩn kháng nước và kháng bụi IP68, IP69 và IP69+. Điều này cho phép thiết bị có thể chịu được việc ngâm nước ở độ sâu 1,5 mét trong 30 phút, tia nước áp lực cao cũng như tiếp xúc với nước nóng ở nhiệt độ cao.Những tiêu chuẩn này giúp người dùng an tâm hơn khi sử dụng thiết bị trong thời gian...",

Từ những chính sách vĩ mô của Chính phủ đến các sản phẩm công nghệ “Make in Vietnam” như robot hình người, thiết bị bay không người lái (UAV) hay trợ lý ảo, có thể thấy trí tuệ Việt đang từng bước thoát khỏi cái bóng của gia công, lắp ráp để tiến gần hơn tới sân chơi của người làm chủ.Thực tiễn này phản ánh rõ tinh thần đổi mới tư duy phát triển được thể hiện trong các dự thảo văn kiện trình Đại hội lần thứ XIV của Đảng, trong đó khoa học, công nghệ và đổi mới sáng tạo tiếp tục được nhấn mạnh là động lực quan trọng nhằm nâng cao năng suất, chất lượng và sức cạnh tranh của nền kinh tế, gắn với yêu cầu tăng cường năng lực tự chủ công nghệ, từng bước làm chủ các khâu cốt lõi và củng cố nền tảng cho chủ quyền số quốc gia.Việc hình thành ngày càng nhiều sản phẩm công nghệ do người Việt Nam thiết kế và làm chủ, từng bước tiếp cận thị trường khu vực và quốc tế, không chỉ cho thấy sự gia tăng của năng lực sáng tạo nội sinh, mà còn phản ánh xu hướng chuyển dịch từ tư duy tiếp cận, học hỏi sang nỗ lực vươn lên nấc thang cao hơn trong chuỗi giá trị, phù hợp với khát vọng phát triển đất nước nhanh và bền vững trong kỷ nguyên số mà Đại hội XIV hướng tới.Cơ hội cuối cùng để thoát khỏi bẫy thu nhập trung bìnhĐể AI phát triển đúng hướng, trên tinh thần Nghị quyết 57 (Bộ Chính trị) về phát triển khoa học công nghệ, đổi mới sáng tạo và chuyển đổi số quốc gia, Chính phủ Việt Nam đã xác lập một bộ khung chiến lược rõ ràng. Theo Quyết định ban hành 11 nhóm công nghệ chiến lược, AI được xác định là một trong những nhóm công nghệ quan trọng. Đây là bệ phóng để các bộ, ngành triển khai nguồn lực một cách tập trung thay vì phân tán.Bên cạnh đó, Quốc hội cũng đã ban hành Luật Trí tuệ nhân tạo, nhấn mạnh quan điểm xuyên suốt là đảm bảo con người luôn kiểm soát trí tuệ nhân tạo.Việc xây dựng hành lang pháp lý này không phải để kìm hãm, mà để tạo ra một sandbox (thử nghiệm) an toàn, giúp doanh nghiệp phát triển, các startup có thể thử nghiệm AI mà không vi phạm các chuẩn mực đạo đức hay an ninh quốc gia.

  "text": "Trong bối cảnh cuộc Cách mạng Công nghiệp lần thứ tư đang diễn ra mạnh mẽ trên toàn cầu, Việt Nam đã xác định trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) là một trong những công nghệ chiến lược then chốt nhằm tạo đột phá về năng suất lao động và thúc đẩy kinh tế số phát triển bền vững. Định hướng này đang tiếp tục được làm rõ trong quá trình xây dựng và hoàn thiện các văn kiện trình Đại hội lần thứ XIV của Đảng, trong đó khoa học, công nghệ và đổi mới sáng tạo được xác định là những trụ cột quan trọng của chiến lược phát triển đất nước giai đoạn tới.Trí tuệ nhân tạo không còn là một khái niệm xa vời, mà đang từng bước trở thành động cơ mới, góp phần nâng cao hiệu quả quản trị, sản xuất và dịch vụ, đồng thời mở ra dư địa hiện thực hóa khát vọng đưa Việt Nam vươn lên nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh công nghệ trong khu vực và trên thế giới.Để từng bước hiện thực hóa tầm nhìn đó, Việt Nam đang triển khai các bước đi căn cơ, từ hoàn thiện hành lang pháp lý, xây dựng và triển khai chiến lược quốc gia về trí tuệ nhân tạo, đến việc nuôi dưỡng và phát triển các tập đoàn công nghệ trong nước đủ năng lực làm chủ công nghệ lõi, tham gia sâu hơn vào chuỗi giá trị toàn cầu, qua đó cụ thể hóa các mục tiêu phát triển lớn trong giai đoạn tới.Luật Trí tuệ nhân tạo trở thành bệ phóngBước ngoặt lớn nhất trong hành trình chinh phục công nghệ của Việt Nam chính là việc Quốc hội khóa XV thông qua Luật Trí tuệ nhân tạo vào ngày 10/12/2025. Đây là đạo luật đầu tiên của Việt Nam điều chỉnh toàn diện về phát triển, ứng dụng và quản trị trí tuệ nhân tạo, đánh dấu sự trưởng thành trong tư duy quản lý nhà nước trước những biến động không ngừng của công nghệ.Tỷ lệ tán thành cao khẳng định sự đồng thuận mạnh mẽ về sự cần thiết của một hành lang pháp lý chặt chẽ về lĩnh vực trí tuệ nhân tạo (Ảnh: P.V).Luật này không đơn thuần là những quy định khô khan, mà thực chất là một hành lang an toàn giúp các doanh nghiệp tự tin sáng tạo mà không lo ngại về những rủi ro pháp lý tiềm ẩn.Chia sẻ tại Tuần lễ Số Quốc tế Việt Nam (Viet Nam International Digital Week – VIDW 2025), Bộ trưởng Bộ Khoa học và Công nghệ Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng nhận định AI cần được dẫn dắt trong một “hành lang hẹp”, giữa 2 thái cực hỗn loạn và kiểm soát, tự do và lo sợ.“Nhiệm vụ của chúng ta không phải là làm chậm đổi mới, mà là định hướng nó bằng sự khôn ngoan và trách nhiệm.

  "text": "Mới đây, cộng đồng mạng tại Việt Nam xôn xao trước việc Zalo cập nhật các điều khoản dịch vụ mới, đi kèm \"tối hậu thư\" 45 ngày. Nếu không đồng ý, tài khoản sẽ bị xóa hoặc hạn chế.Bên cạnh đó, Luật Bảo vệ dữ liệu cá nhân cũng bắt đầu có hiệu lực từ ngày 1/1. Những thay đổi này khiến người dân trở nên chú ý hơn đến dữ liệu cá nhân khi sử dụng mạng xã hội.Phóng viên Dân trí đã có cuộc trò chuyện với chuyên gia an ninh mạng Ngô Minh Hiếu (Hiếu PC) để chia sẻ thêm về vấn đề trên dưới góc nhìn chuyên môn.Tiềm ẩn rủi ro gì nếu xảy ra sự cố lộ lọt dữ liệu?Dưới góc độ an ninh mạng, việc một ứng dụng nhắn tin sở hữu \"bức chân dung định danh\" quá chi tiết (gồm CCCD và hình ảnh cá nhân) tiềm ẩn rủi ro gì nếu xảy ra sự cố lộ lọt dữ liệu thưa ông?- Nếu một nền tảng nhắn tin nắm “bộ hồ sơ định danh” gồm CCCD và ảnh chân dung (thậm chí có cả dữ liệu sinh trắc học như khuôn mặt/giọng nói), thì khi lộ lọt sẽ thành rủi ro dài hạn vì đây là dữ liệu khó “đổi” như mật khẩu. Luật cũng đã coi dữ liệu sinh trắc học là một nhóm dữ liệu cần bảo vệ chặt, hạn chế truy cập và giám sát.Ở góc nhìn tội phạm mạng, “combo” này rất béo bở để kẻ gian thực hiện kế hoạch lừa đảo, mạo danh hoặc dựng kịch bản social engineering khiến nạn nhân tin “đúng người thật”. Với những nền tảng ở mức hàng chục triệu người dùng hàng tháng, chỉ cần một phần nhỏ dữ liệu bị lộ đã là “mỏ vàng” cho kẻ xấu.Hiếu PC nhận định các dữ liệu như CCCD hay ảnh chân dung có thể trở thành \"mỏ vàng\" cho kẻ gian nếu không được kiểm soát chặt chẽ (Ảnh: Hiếu PC).Nói về Zalo, đầu tháng 1, nền tảng này đã chuyển từ yêu cầu ảnh giấy tờ sang xác minh gương mặt và giọng nói qua video call. Giải pháp này giúp giảm rủi ro “lộ ảnh CCCD”, nhưng lại phát sinh bài toán mới về dữ liệu sinh trắc học.Zalo cần phải đảm bảo bảo mật thông tin, an ninh thông tin cho các dữ liệu và phải báo cáo, chịu trách nhiệm khi có sự cố lộ lọt dữ liệu xảy ra. Mới đây, Zalo lý giải việc thu thập dữ liệu là để \"phục vụ người dùng tốt hơn\". Theo ông, có ranh giới nào giữa việc \"cá nhân hóa trải nghiệm\" và \"xâm phạm đời tư\" mà các nền tảng thường lờ đi không?Ranh giới nằm ở 2 chữ: cần thiết và đúng mục đích. Cá nhân hóa hợp lý là “thu đúng phần cần để chạy tính năng bạn dùng”. Trong khi đó, xâm phạm là...",

Tập đoàn tập trung vào việc làm chủ công nghệ lõi nhằm giảm phụ thuộc vào bên ngoài, đáp ứng yêu cầu tùy biến theo nhiệm vụ và bảo đảm an ninh hệ thống trong dài hạn.Việc Tập đoàn Viettel nghiên cứu và thử nghiệm thành công máy bay không người lái (UAV) có tầm bay xa tới 1.000km là một minh chứng đanh thép cho năng lực tự chủ về công nghệ quốc phòng và dân dụng. UAV do Viettel nghiên cứu và phát triển (Ảnh: Thành Đông).Đây không chỉ đơn thuần là một thiết bị bay, mà là sự tích hợp của hàng loạt công nghệ lõi: Từ vật liệu composite siêu nhẹ, hệ thống điều khiển thông minh, thuật toán AI tối ưu hóa đường bay cho đến công nghệ truyền tín hiệu bảo mật.Việc làm chủ công nghệ UAV tầm xa góp phần nâng cao năng lực tự chủ công nghệ của Việt Nam, tạo tiền đề để tham gia sâu hơn vào các lĩnh vực công nghiệp công nghệ cao, trong đó có những ngành đòi hỏi trình độ nghiên cứu và tích hợp công nghệ tiên tiến.Bên cạnh đó, quyết tâm hướng tới một hệ...",

Máy cũng tích hợp đa dạng tính năng AI hỗ trợ làm việc và chỉnh sửa hình ảnh.Với những người dùng có nhu cầu “cày” game và giải trí nặng, đây không phải là lựa chọn phù hợp.Thiết kế và màn hìnhTrong vài năm trở lại đây, phân khúc di động cận cao cấp tại thị trường Việt Nam ngày càng trở nên sôi động. Đây được xem là một bước đệm để các nhà sản xuất có thể dần chuyển dịch khách hàng dùng smartphone bình dân lên những lựa chọn cao hơn.Apple có iPhone 16e, trong khi Samsung cũng giới thiệu Galaxy S25 FE để thúc đẩy thị trường. Các nhà sản xuất smartphone Trung Quốc như OPPO, Xiaomi hay vivo thậm chí còn cạnh tranh quyết liệt hơn khi mỗi năm ra mắt tới 2 thiết bị thuộc phân khúc này.OPPO Reno15 5G được công bố chỉ 6 tháng sau khi phiên bản Reno14 lên kệ. Máy vẫn giữ nguyên thiết kế đặc trưng của dòng sản phẩm Reno. Thiết kế này đã được hãng áp dụng gần như không đổi trong 3 thế hệ gần nhau, tạo nên đặc điểm nhận diện riêng cho sản phẩm Reno trên thị trường.Đây vừa là điểm cộng nhưng cũng có thể là hạn chế. Thiết kế này vẫn đủ trẻ trung, bắt mắt, nhưng không còn tạo được sự mới mẻ như ban đầu. Thiết bị được gia công và hoàn thiện tương đối tỉ mỉ, tiệm cận với chất lượng trên những mẫu điện thoại thuộc phân khúc cao cấp. Mặt lưng của Reno15 5G được hoàn thiện dạng nhám mờ, giúp hạn chế bám dấu vân tay trong quá trình sử dụng. Bốn góc bo cong đều kết hợp với kích thước nhỏ gọn, mang lại trải nghiệm cầm nắm thoải mái ngay cả khi sử dụng bằng một tay trong thời gian dài.Màn hình của Reno15 5G có kích thước 6,59 inch, sử dụng tấm nền AMOLED với độ phân giải 1,5K cùng tần số quét 120Hz.

Here are the main points: War economy: The drone is designed to excel in situations in which it has to meet a dense air defense network, complex radar and systems, tanks and artillery — the UAV can crush expensive systems while having a low production cost itself, turning itself into an \"economic hammer.\" Tactical flexibility: Lancet’s loitering capability makes it an active hunter on the battlefield, not just a munition. This reduces the need for expensive airstrikes and minimizes risks for manned aircraft. Outplaying short-range air defense: The drone can also exploit vulnerabilities of low-altitude air defense systems, which allows it to bypass most protective layers to achieve combat goals. Not just a munition: What makes it really efficient is its integration with reconnaissance and AI systems and command networks, which elevates Lancet from a flying projectile to a smart deadly weapon. Such loitering munitions are becoming the new norm of modern conflicts, with major powers creating complex systems combining drones, AI and electronic warfare, while others just buy cheap UAVs. This creates an imbalance as the ability to strike no longer equates to the ability to survive on the battlefield, ushering in a new era of low-cost, high-impact warfare and forcing armies to revise combat doctrines, Hatem Saber concludes.

Furthermore, Netanyahu believes that the current US plan is not effective enough and will not produce the desired results, the report said citing one of the prime minister's advisers. The phone call between the leaders took place on Wednesday, January 14, when Trump was expected to launch airstrikes against Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Salman also spoke out against the strikes in a phone call with Trump, citing concerns about regional security, Axios noted. However, due to insufficient military equipment in the region, warnings from allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, concerns from senior advisers about the consequences and effectiveness of possible strike options, and secret backchannel talks with the Iranians, Trump decided not to order the attack, Axios said. Amid protests in Iran, Trump canceled all contacts with Iranian officials, supported the protesters, and allowed for all possible actions against Iran, including airstrikes. Tehran, for its part, warned that Trump's statements threatened the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic. israel iran Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2026 Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Sputnik International trump-netanyahu, iran strike, us-iran war, israel-iran war, strike on iran, iran strike, us strike, military aggression, unprovoked aggression, undeclared war, us attack, us hegemony trump-netanyahu, iran strike, us-iran war, israel-iran war, strike on iran, iran strike, us strike, military aggression, unprovoked aggression, undeclared war, us attack, us hegemony 05:08 GMT 19.01.2026 (Updated: 05:10 GMT 19.01.2026 ) © AP Photo / Saul Loeb President Donald Trump listens to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he speaks at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. © AP Photo / Saul Loeb Subscribe WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US President Donald Trump's decision not to strike Iran this week may have been influenced by a warning from his ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pointed out Israel's lack of preparedness to defend itself in the event of a retaliatory strike from Tehran,...",

He also complained about dire supply shortages in the Ukrainian armed forces — water was scarce, drones dropped food infrequently and only \"snack items.\" Sotnikov said that he was forcibly mobilized despite having no prior military service and holding a mobilization deferment.

On Saturday, Reuters reported, citing EU diplomats, that EU ambassadors were being called to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday amid threats by US President Donald Trump to impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland in February, which would later increase to 25% and remain in effect until the United States signs a deal on the purchase of Greenland. Trump has repeatedly said that Greenland should become part of the United States, citing its strategic importance for national security. Denmark's and Greenland's authorities have warned the US against seizing the island, stressing that they expect respect for their shared territorial integrity. The island was a Danish colony until 1953.

  "title": "Trung Quốc phục chế \"áo giáp vàng\" huyền thoại thời nhà Đường được tìm thấy ở Tây Tạng",
  "text": "“Chưa diệt xong giặc thì quyết không rời sa mạc, dẫu trong chinh chiến áo giáp vàng có mòn nát trăm lần”. Trong bài thơ nổi tiếng thời nhà Đường, nhà thơ Vương Xương Linh đã khắc họa tinh thần bất khuất của những binh sĩ khoác giáp vàng chiến đấu nơi biên cương sa mạc. Suốt nhiều thế kỷ, vẻ huy hoàng của những bộ giáp mạ vàng thời Đường chỉ tồn tại trong thơ ca và trí tưởng tượng, bởi chưa từng có hiện vật nào được khai quật. Điều đó chỉ thực sự thay đổi vào tuần trước, khi Phòng thí nghiệm trọng điểm về Khoa học Khảo cổ và Di sản Văn hóa thuộc Viện Khoa học Xã hội Trung Quốc (CASS) công bố bộ “giáp vàng” thời Đường duy nhất được biết đến cho tới nay – một bộ giáp đồng mạ vàng được phục dựng công phu, tìm thấy trong một ngôi mộ hoàng gia trên cao nguyên Tây Tạng. Nhóm phục dựng không chỉ ghép lại từng mảnh giáp mà còn dựng một video tái hiện hình dáng ban đầu của bộ giáp theo đánh giá khoa học. Các hiện vật, bao gồm giáp trụ, đồ sơn mài và đồ kim loại, được thu hồi và phục dựng từ các lăng mộ hoàng gia của Thổ Dục Hồn trong giai đoạn 2022–2025. Các mảnh giáp được chụp ảnh trong quá trình khai quật. Ảnh: SCMP. “Chúng tôi áp dụng chiến lược ‘tháo rời tổng thể thành từng bộ phận rồi lắp ghép các bộ phận thành một chỉnh thể’, tiến hành làm sạch, bóc tách và bảo vệ theo từng lớp, đồng thời ghi chép, phân loại tỉ mỉ từng phiến giáp”, chuyên gia bảo tồn di sản văn hóa Quách Chính Thần cho biết tại buổi họp báo công bố bộ giáp ngày 14/1. Ngôi mộ hoàng gia này từng bị đào trộm và khai quật cứu hộ, khiến các phiến giáp bị vỡ vụn và xuống cấp nghiêm trọng. Một báo cáo khai quật công bố năm 2024 trên tạp chí Archaeology mô tả phát hiện này như sau: “Nhiều phiến giáp đồng đã được tìm thấy… các phiến có hình gần giống chữ nhật, cạnh dưới bo bán nguyệt… đồng thời còn phát hiện số lượng lớn các mảnh giáp sơn mài”. Các mảnh giáp đồng và giáp sơn mài nằm lẫn lộn, chất đống, không còn mối liên hệ kết cấu rõ ràng, trong tình trạng cực kỳ mong manh, có nguy cơ vỡ nát chỉ với một tác động nhẹ. “Chúng tôi ghi lại toàn bộ thông tin không gian ban đầu của từng phiến giáp bằng công nghệ quét 3D, đồng thời phân tích kỹ thuật chế tác và thành phần vật liệu bằng kính hiển vi điện tử quét và kính hiển vi siêu độ sâu”, nhóm bảo tồn cho biết. Kết quả phân tích cho thấy đây không đơn thuần là giáp đồng, mà là...",

Việc ông Trump đe dọa áp thuế lên Phần Lan và một loạt đồng minh châu Âu, tưởng như chỉ là một đợt tranh chấp thương mại nữa giữa lục địa này và bên kia Đại Tây Dương, nhưng phản ứng dây chuyền từ Bắc Âu đến Brussels cho thấy câu chuyện đã vượt khỏi phạm vi kinh tế. Đây là biểu hiện của sự tái cấu trúc liên minh trong bối cảnh Washington chuyển từ \"bảo lãnh an ninh\" sang \"giao dịch quyền lực\". Trong phép tính quyền lực kiểu Trump, đòn kinh tế được dùng như đòn ngoại giao, và đôi khi là đòn an ninh. Châu Âu coi đó là tín hiệu rủi ro: khi nguyên tắc trong liên minh bị thay bằng mặc cả, thì niềm tin - tài sản quan trọng nhất của NATO - đã trở thành biến số. Phản ứng của giới lãnh đạo Phần Lan mang nhiều tầng: Tổng thống Alexander Stubb và Thủ tướng Petteri Orpo đều nhấn mạnh: Tranh chấp giữa đồng minh phải được giải quyết bằng quy tắc và đối thoại,...",

Trong dòng chảy đó, các giải pháp thanh toán của VPBank hiện diện như một phần quen thuộc, hỗ trợ để việc chi trả diễn ra nhanh hơn, thuận tiện hơn, an toàn và bảo mật hơn, đồng thời mang lại những giá trị gia tăng cho người dùng thông qua các ưu đãi đi kèm. Sự thay đổi này cũng đặt ra kỳ vọng mới cho ngân hàng trong việc kiến tạo trải nghiệm thanh toán cho người dùng. Thanh toán không chỉ cần nhanh, mà còn phải dễ sử dụng và phù hợp với nhiều tình huống đời thường. Và đây là cách Siêu giải pháp thanh toán VPBank tiếp cận, xem thanh toán số như một hệ sinh thái, nơi cả khách hàng cá nhân lẫn khách hàng hộ kinh doanh đều có thể tìm thấy giải pháp phù hợp với nhu cầu.

  "text": "Article content In the current economic climate, attracting investment from non-U.S.-based companies is a victory in itself, said Brendan Sweeney, director of the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing at Western University . Article content Article content “The bright spot is that we have, whether it was 40 years ago with Toyota or whether it was a couple years ago with Volkswagen and now Vianode, we’ve attracted major investments from companies that are not U.S.-based and that seem to want to want to be here,” he said. Article content “They are companies with a long-time horizon for return on investment. They’re not as influenced by U.S. policy as they are by global technological trends … and they’re not about to let a weird president from another country dictate how they’re going to do business.” Article content Article content Article content Canadian-built vehicles shine bright Article content With the review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement, better known as CUSMA, just months away, any leverage Canada can gain will be important in negotiations. Article content Article content It doesn’t hurt that some of the best and most sought-after vehicles in North America are made in Canada, since a breakdown of the trilateral trade pact would inevitably drive up prices for consumers south of the border — a prospect that carries political risks for U.S. President Donald Trump. Article content That point was underscored this past week, when the Windsor-made Dodge Charger was crowned North American car of the year at the Detroit Auto Show. Article content Two other Canadian-built vehicles — the Woodstock-made Toyota RAV4 and the Alliston-built Honda CR-V – topped the lists of best-selling vehicles in both Canada and the U.S. in 2025, rankings that could offer some stability for workers at those plants. Article content Article content “Toyota and Honda don’t have a whole lot of spare capacity kicking around North America or globally that they can say, ‘Oh, we can pull this product out of Canada and move it someplace else,’” Mordue said. Article content “It’s not to say that they couldn’t build it, but building it takes time, and they are not anxious to do that.” Article content Article content Article content Stellantis adds third shift; battery plant begins production Article content While Stellantis ’s decision to move production of the Jeep Compass from Brampton to Illinois dealt a blow to the industry, some of that pain has been offset by the automaker’s addition of a third shift at its Windsor plant. Article content The shift — which ended about six years ago and has now been reinstated to support production of the SIXPACK-powered Dodge Charger R/T and four-door SIXPACK-powered Charger models — allowed hundreds of Brampton workers to relocate to Windsor.

  "title": "Armed Windsor carjacker had bullet in chamber, sought police confrontation",
  "text": "A young Windsor man who attempted an armed carjacking on Walker Road last June with a loaded assault rifle was actually at a desperate point in his life and seeking a “suicide-by-cop” confrontation with police, a judge heard this week. Windsor police officers who raced to the scene in response to emergency calls from witnesses “exercised incredible restraint” in ending a fraught situation with no injuries or loss of life, defence lawyer Dan Scott told a sentencing hearing in the Ontario Court of Justice. Investigators later discovered there had been a live round in the chamber of the modified SKS assault rifle, with a handful of additional bullets ready to be fired with the squeeze of a trigger. “Six individuals in the community, including himself, could have been harmed,” assistant Crown attorney Jayme Lesperance told the court. “I cannot imagine the fear or terror felt (by the targeted motorist and bystanders),” he added, describing it as the type of event that is “so traumatic and engenders so much fear in the community … this can happen to anyone.” A pre-sentence report prepared for this week’s hearing before Ontario Court Justice Daniel Topp described the man, now 24 years old, as “a ticking time bomb on the day of the offence.” Suffering from anxiety disorder, PTSD and other mental illness, the young man was described as homeless and using alcohol and drugs to cope, including from the recent loss of a three-month-old son due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). That had also led to the subsequent falling-apart of his relationship with his fiancé. The infant’s death “put him in a tailspin,” said his lawyer. “He knows he’s smart, he just fell off the tracks real bad.” Wandering the street with a loaded assault rifle, trying to rob a motorist of his vehicle, “it could have ended horribly, for anyone involved,” Scott said. Citing early guilty pleas on several of the criminal charges, as well as the offender’s young age and mental illness, which is now being addressed, both the defence and Crown recommended a five-year prison sentence. Lesperance, who said a message of denunciation and deterrence is the fundamental principle in such crimes, called the five years a “significant sentence in the Canadian justice system.” Using a standard formula, Scott requested his client receive 351 days credit for 234 days spent in actual pre-sentence custody (as of Friday) since his June 3 arrest. That would leave a balance of about four years left to serve. Justice Topp concurred with the joint submission on Friday and sentenced the man to five years in prison, minus time served in pre-sentence custody. “The community needs to know that you cannot be walking around with a loaded firearm,” Topp said when reading out his sentence, adding that the man’s actions had “to be denounced”. “This used to be something we read in the newspapers. Gun violence was a Toronto problem, it was a Detroit problem, not a Walker Road problem.” Invited by the judge...",

  "title": "Трамп купив облігації Netflix і Warner Bros. після оголошення про їхнє злиття",
  "text": "Президент США Дональд Трамп придбав облігації Netflix та кінокомпанії Warner Bros. Discovery на суму до 2 мільйонів доларів через кілька тижнів після того, як компанії оголосили про можливе злиття. Про це повідомляє Reuters, передає Укрінформ. Як зазначається, Трамп з середини листопада до кінця грудня 2025 року придбав облігації на суму близько 100 мільйонів доларів. Згідно з фінансовими звітами, опублікованими наприкінці минулого тижня, більшість придбаних ним цінних паперів становлять муніципальні облігації міст, шкільних округів, комунальних підприємств і лікарень.  Крім того, Трамп придбав облігації компаній Boeing, Occidental Petroleum, General Motors, а також Netflix і Warner Bros. Discovery. У грудні президент США заявив, що матиме право голосу щодо надання дозволу на придбання компанії Warner Bros. Discovery сервісом Netflix майже за 83 мільярди доларів. Про бажання придбати Warner Bros. Discovery заявляла також компанія Paramount Skydance. Будь-яка угода щодо придбання Warner Bros. потребуватиме схвалення регуляторами у США. Посадовець Білого дому на умовах анонімності повідомив Reuters, що портфель акцій та облігацій Трампа незалежно управляється сторонніми фінансовими установами, і ані президент, ані будь-який член його родини не має змоги керувати, впливати або надавати пропозиції щодо того, куди інвестувати.

Серед її прибуткових франшиз — «Гаррі Поттер», «Гра престолів», «Друзі» та всесвіт DC Comics, а також такі класичні фільми, як «Касабланка» та «Громадянин Кейн».  5 грудня Netflix та Warner Bros. Discovery оголосили про угоду на суму 82,7 мільярда доларів щодо придбання кіно- й телевізійної студій та інших активів.  Наприкінці грудня Paramount Skydance оновила свою пропозицію на придбання активів Warner Bros. Discovery, піднявши суму до 108,4 мільярда доларів, проте рада директорів корпорації Warner Bros. Discovery відхилила її.  Paramount Skydance подала позов до Канцлерського суду штату Делавер, вимагаючи розкриття фінансового аналізу, на якому базується рішення правління Warner Bros. підтримати злиття з Netflix.

  "title": "Помер кінорежисер Disney, який працював над мультфільмами «Алладін» та «Русалонька»",
  "text": "Кінорежисер компанії Disney Роджер Аллерс, який працював над мультфільмами «Алладін», «Красуня і Чудовисько» та «Русальнока», а також виступав співрежисером мультфільму «Король Лев», помер у віці 76 років. Як передає Укрінформ, про це повідомляє The Guardian із посиланням на заяву колеги Аллерса із Disney Дейва Боссерта. Боссерт оголосив про смерть Аллерса вранці у неділю, згадавши його як «надзвичайно обдарованого художника та кінорежисера, справжнього стовпа відродження анімації Disney». Виконавчий директор Disney Роберт Айгер згадував Аллерса як «креативного візіонера, чий великий внесок у розвиток Disney буде жити у наступних поколіннях». «Його робота допомогла визначити епоху анімації, яка продовжує надихати глядачів у всьому світі, і ми глибоко вдячні за все, що він дав Disney», – йдеться у заяві Айгера. Аллерс захопився анімацією у п'ять років, після перегляду мультфільму «Пітер Пен» від Disney. Він розпочав свою кар’єру в Disney із роботи над фільмом «Трон» (1982 рік) як член команди, що створювала розкадрування, потім працював художником-розкадрувальником над мультфільмами «Олівер і Компанія» (1988 рік), «Русалонька» (1989 рік) і «Рятувальники в Австралії (1990 рік). Пізніше став провідним сценаристом мультфільму «Красуня і Чудовисько» (1991 рік) та працював над мультфільмом «Алладін» (1992 рік). У 1994 році Аллерс і американський режисер Роб Мінкофф спільно зняли мультфільм «Король Лев», який став наймасовішим анімаційним фільмом року. Мультфільм посів друге місце за всю історію кіно, поступившись лише фільму «Парк Юрського періоду». «Король Лев» залишається найкасовішим мультфільмом, намальованим вручну, за усю історію, а також найпродаванішим мультфільмом на відеоносіях, проданим у кількості понад 55 млн копій по всьому світі. За цей мультфільм Аллерс і Мінкофф отримали «Золотий глобус» за найкращий комедійний фільм або мюзикл. Крім цього, Аллерс із американською сценаристкою Айрін Меччі написав адаптацію «Короля Лева» для Бродвейського театру, яка отримала премію «Тоні» у 1988 році і досі ставиться у театрах по всьому світу. Аллерс під час роботи у Disney також працював над мультфільмами «Ліло і Стіч» та «Пригоди імператора». Він також був співрежисером мультфільму «Сезон полювання» – першого повнометражного мультфільму анімаційної студії Sony Pictures Animation – разом із американською художницею-мультиплікаторкою Джилл Калтон. Як повідомляв Укрінформ, у вересні 2025 року помер 83-річний британський художник-постановник Стюарт Крейг, який працював над стрічками «Англійський пацієнт», «Людина-слон», фільмами про Гаррі Поттера та іншими.

  "title": "«Під час війни багато хто приходить до мистецтва з болем - як до розради» - іконописиця Тетяна Дзядик",
  "text": "Художниця поєднує мистецькі вміння з волонтерством, також вчить живопису інших Доволі вузьким напрямом художньої роботи Тетяни Дзядик залишається саме іконопис. Та передусім вона – людина, у якої мистецтво не відокремлюється від життя. Тетяни Дзядик ДО ІКОНОПИСУ – ЧЕРЕЗ КОМБІНАТ ЗОЛОТОГО ШИТВА Тетяна розповідає, що й росла у творчій родині, і сама завжди тягнулася до мистецтва. - Мені було цікаво робити все руками. Люблю навіть шпаклювати. Люблю, коли матеріал слухається, коли ти його відчуваєш. Люблю в’язати, щось будувати, ремонтувати. Ми з чоловіком сарай самі робили – я в усьому допомагала. Це важко, але мені страшенно подобається, – каже вона. Свій шлях у мистецтві Дзядик почала з художньої школи, а далі вступила на мистецький факультет університету в Кропивницькому (нині – Центральноукраїнський державний університет). - У нас викладали художники, які закінчували академії Києва, Одеси, Львова. Ми отримали дуже сильну академічну базу, – розповідає художниця. Згадує, що за кілька років «черезтинне радіо» привело її в місце, яке і стало для неї початком іконопису – на комбінат золотого шитва у Кропивницькому. - Це такий комбінат, про який мало хто знає. Там вишивають ікони й одяг для священнослужителів. Мітри, ризи, ікони із золотими нитками, напівдорогоцінним камінням. Але за каноном не можна вишивати обличчя й руки – тільки малювати. І їм були потрібні художники, які можуть писати лик. Тож Тетяні запропонували спробувати написати лик Христа, але їй не одразу вдалося. - Я написала портретно – зі синіми, жовтими відтінками, дуже живописно. Вийшло гарно. Але мені сказали, що так не пишуть. Лики мають бути в земляних, глиняних тонах. Мене буквально перевчали. Читала літературу, вивчала канони. Художниця говорить, що все ж академічний живопис та гідне вміння писати портрети стали у пригоді під час навчання. Тепер, після років відточування майстерності, Тетяна працює у складній традиційній техніці. Основою для ікони стає дерев’яна дошка. Вона проходить складну підготовку: на неї накладають тонку тканину, проклеюють, наносять левкас – кілька шарів спеціальної ґрунтовки, що створює м’яку, пружну поверхню. Далі – шар червоної глини, на якому виконують рельєфи під майбутню роботу. Саме на цій основі з’являється живопис. Із цим етапом Тетяні допомагає майстер – вона починає виконувати свою частину роботи вже на підготовленій основі. Іконописиця працює з багатошаровим нанесенням фарб. Раніше це була класична темпера, яку вона навіть намагалася готувати самостійно – з яєчного жовтка. Тепер використовує різні фарби, головне – досягти тієї ж глибини напівпрозорих лесирувань. Фарбу художниця наносить шарами: від темного до світлого, з постійними «заливками», з м’якими переходами, у яких світло ніби виходить ізсередини. Пише повільно, уважно, маленькими пензлями – іноді буквально на одну волосину. Окремий етап – позолота. Для неї використовують поталь, нанесену на спеціально підготовлену основу. Тетяна розповіла, що процес роботи може тривати від одного дня – для невеликих образів – до кількох тижнів і більше – для складних багатофігурних композицій. ІКОНОПИС ТА УПЕРЕДЖЕННЯ Це мистецтво все ж сакральне, пов'язане з певними обрядами. Але Тетяна говорить, що для неї головнішим є її стан, ніж обрядовість. - Не можу сказати, що дотримуюся релігійного обряду під час написання ікон. Але коли я пишу, не вживаю алкогольні напої, не лаюся, стараюся бути спокійною....",

  "title": "Antártida, la geografía del silencio helado",
  "text": "Escribo en la Antártida . He llegado tras casi veinticuatro horas de navegación dura por el Pasaje de Drake y sus aguas rabiosas. Desde Ushuaia, la ciudad del fin del mundo. El viaje es una forma lenta de desprendimiento más que un simple traslado geográfico. A medida que el barco avanza, el continente habitado queda atrás y, con él, la costumbre de medirlo todo en función de la utilidad, de la posesión, del rendimiento. En estas latitudes, el mar, el hielo y la luz componen el espectáculo. No hay monumentos ni ciudades, ni historia visible que distraiga la mirada. Todo sucede en una coreografía elemental, casi primitiva, donde esos tres elementos se combinan y se separan sin pausa, como si el paisaje estuviera siempre en ensayo. El mar como escenario El mar es una superficie viva, cambiante. A ratos de un negro profundo, casi mineral; a ratos pulida como un espejo que duplica el cielo. Desde la cubierta, el agua funciona como un escenario móvil que amplifica la sensación de aislamiento. Sin horizonte urbano que tranquilice. Sin referencia humana que sirva de ancla. Solo una línea inestable entre lo líquido y lo helado, recordándonos que aquí todo es transitorio, incluso lo que parece eterno. Sensación de soledad, de pequeñez, de rendición ante la majestad de la naturaleza. Arrobamiento ante formas que el tiempo largo, desprovisto de calendarios y de la insistencia de fechas, ha diseñado para luego eliminar el imposible de lo inmutable. El hielo es el verdadero protagonista. Se presenta como una galería de formas irrepetibles: torres, arcos, catedrales efímeras talladas por el tiempo. Cada iceberg es una pieza única, con engañosas vetas azules que cargan siglos de compresión, con superficies que crujen, se desprenden, se transforman. Es un hielo inquieto, que respira, se mueve, suena. Materia viva en estado lento. ¿Masa inerte? No, es un proceso. Luz y continente para mirar Luego está la luz, que ilumina y esculpe. Baja, oblicua, cambiante, convierte cada escena en otra distinta pocos minutos después. Un glaciar puede pasar del blanco opaco al azul eléctrico, del gris metálico al rosa tenue del atardecer que llega y se transforma imperceptiblemente en amanecer, tras el breve tránsito de sombras. La luz antártica embellece lo que revela y, paralelamente, expone la escala, el vacío, la fragilidad. Interroga sin consolar. Desde el barco en que navegamos —sin desembarcar— ese tríptico de mar, hielo y luz se despliega sin interrupciones. La prisa es tan inexistente como los trayectos que cumplir a pie. El espectáculo sucede frente a los ojos, continuo, silencioso, absorbente. La Antártida es un continente que se contempla, y en esa contemplación prolongada uno entiende que su belleza no está en el acceso, sino en la distancia respetuosa. Aquí, acercarse demasiado equivale a traicionar el sentido del lugar. Antes del hielo Suele imaginarse la Antártida como un territorio inmóvil, eterno, condenado desde siempre al hielo. Esa imagen es engañosa. La Antártida no nació congelada ni aislada. Tuvo historia, clima, vegetación y vida. Su blancura actual...",

  "text": "El año 2025 fue el tercero más cálido jamás registrado en el mundo, anunciaron este miércoles el observatorio europeo Copernicus y el instituto estadounidense Berkeley Earth , que prevén que 2026 se mantenga en niveles históricamente altos. El termómetro mundial se mantiene desde hace tres años en niveles nunca vistos en la historia de la humanidad y, por primera vez, la temperatura media de los últimos tres años superó en más de 1.5°C el nivel preindustrial , señaló Copernicus en su informe anual. \"El brutal aumento registrado entre 2023 y 2025 fue extremo y apunta a una aceleración del calentamiento global\", advirtieron los científicos de Berkeley Earth . La ONU , numerosos climatólogos y responsables políticos llevan desde el año pasado asumiendo públicamente que el planeta se encamina hacia un calentamiento duradero de 1.5 °C, el límite simbólico establecido por el Acuerdo de París de lucha contra el cambio climático hace una década. Con tres años consecutivos a ese nivel, Copernicus considera probable que el rebasamiento permanente de ese límite se confirme \"antes de que termine la década, es decir más de diez años antes de lo previsto\". Esta aceleración resulta aún más alarmante ya que coincide en un momento en que Estados Unidos (el segundo mayor emisor de gases de efecto invernadero ) rompió con la cooperación climática internacional bajo Donald Trump y devolvió al petróleo un papel central en su política. - Tendencia para 2026 - Además, en los países ricos, la lucha contra las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero pierde fuelle . En Alemania y Francia , la reducción de emisiones volvió a estancarse en 2025 . Y en Estados Unidos , el repunte de las centrales de carbón impulsó de nuevo al alza la huella de carbono del país, borrando de un plumazo años de avances. \"La urgencia de actuar frente al cambio climático nunca había sido tan apremiante\", afirmó Mauro Facchini , jefe de la unidad Copernicus , durante una rueda de prensa. Nada indica que 2026 vaya a romper esta tendencia. Samantha Burgess , directora adjunta de cambio climático en Copernicus , pronostica que \" 2026 será uno de los cinco años más cálidos jamás registrados\". \"Probablemente sea comparable a 2025 \", señaló. Los climatólogos de Berkeley Earth también prevén que 2026 \"probablemente será similar a 2025 , con el escenario más probable de convertirse en el cuarto año más cálido desde 1850\". Si el fenómeno natural El Niño , con su efecto de calentamiento , vuelve a aparecer, \"podría convertir 2026 en un año récord\", dijo a AFP Carlo Buontempo , director de cambio climático del observatorio. Pero \"que sea en 2026 , 2027 o 2028 no cambia gran cosa. La trayectoria es muy, muy clara\", añadió. - Récords en Asia y en el Antártico - En 2025 , la temperatura del aire en la superficie de las tierras y los océanos fue 1.47°C superior al nivel preindustrial , después de los 1.60°C registrados en 2024, el año récord.

  "text": "La comunidad de Barrero , en el municipio de Imbert , provincia Puerto Plata, no ha dejado la angustia que tomó el 31 de diciembre de 2025, cuando la niña Brianna Genao Rosario , de 3 años, desapareció mientras jugaba en el patio de una vivienda familiar en esa zona rural. La desaparición de la menor fue reportada alrededor de las 5:00 de la tarde de ese día y, desde entonces, las autoridades la buscan sin obtener datos concretos, pese a las múltiples excavaciones en todo el perímetro. El viernes, el flujo de personal que participa en el operativo se redujo visiblemente, con el retiro de unidades del 9-1-1 y drones que apoyaban el rastreo aéreo, aunque aún permanecen agentes de la Policía Nacional y miembros de la Defensa Civil en la zona. Las investigaciones tomaron un giro al señalar a Rafael Rosario Núñez , de 52 años, y Reyes Rosario Núñez , de 43, como sospechosos de su desaparición y presunta muerte. Los dos parientes habrían admitido su participación en el crimen, pero no saben el lugar específico en el que enterraron el cuerpo. Sin embargo, estas supuestas confesiones han generado críticas en la comunidad, debido a que algunos, como el alcalde pedáneo Cornelio Cabrera , aseguran que son hombres tranquilos y sin antecedentes conflictivos. Asimismo, Santos Willy Liriano , abogado de los detenidos , denunció que sus clientes han sido presuntamente torturados. Mientras las interrogantes crecen, el Ministerio Público aún no ha solicitado medida de coerción contra los señalados, la cual debe dentro de 48 horas de su detención. Reclamos de justicia y reacciones en el país La tragedia de Brianna ha sacudido no solo a la comunidad de Barrero , sino también a toda la sociedad dominicana. Carlos Manuel Genao , padre de la niña, exigió que los responsables sean sometidos a la justicia y que se aplique todo el peso de la ley. A raíz de la desaparición de la niña Brianna Genao , el senador de la provincia Duarte, Franklin Romero, aseguró que reintroducirá un proyecto de ley de su autoría con el que busca autorizar la castración química contra los condenados de violencia y abuso sexual. Brianna Genao Rosario, de 3 años, desaparece en horas de la tarde mientras jugaba en el patio de una vivienda familiar en la comunidad de Barrero, municipio de Imbert, Puerto Plata. La familia reporta su desaparición ese mismo día. 31 de diciembre de 2025 Se activa un amplio operativo de búsqueda encabezado por el Sistema 9-1-1, Policía Nacional, Defensa Civil y comunitarios. Se utilizan drones, unidades caninas y rescatistas para rastrear zonas boscosas, cañadas y caminos vecinales cercanos al lugar donde fue vista por última vez. 1 de enero Las autoridades informan el hallazgo de una chancleta que presuntamente pertenecía a la menor, cerca del área de búsqueda inicial.

  "title": "La captura de Maduro y la política exterior de Donald Trump - Diario Li e",
  "text": "Tras un año en el que Donald Trump ha transformado y endurecido enormemente la política exterior de EE. UU., la operación para capturar a Nicolás Maduro en Venezuela ha supuesto una impactante prueba de fuerza y el ejemplo más claro del nuevo tipo orden mundial al que aspiran el republicano y su gabinete. Desde la guerra comercial que lanzó contra sus socios a su apoyo desigual para con Kiev en la Guerra de Ucrania , Trump dejó claro en los primeros meses de su segundo Gobierno que la diplomacia estadounidense había virado, incluso si se la compara con la de su primer mandato, hacia terrenos inexplorados. Entre medias se sucedieron desplantes de diferente calibre, desde afirmaciones sobre la anexión de Groenlandia , la posibilidad de realizar ataques militares sobre el narco en suelo mexicano o el deterioro de la relaciones con la India, un socio estratégico. En verano, Washington llevó a cabo un ataque quirúrgico contra el programa nuclear iraní e inició un despliegue naval inédito en el Caribe -que ha incluido la ejecución sumaria de más de un centenar de supuestos narcotraficantes en alta mar- con el objetivo de presionar a Maduro. La campaña contra el ahora expresidente venezolano fue subiendo de tono, al igual que las amenazas que el republicano fue lanzando también sobre el jefe de Estado colombiano, Gustavo Petro . Pero hasta ese momento todo parecía desarrollarse más o menos sobre la dinámica del acrónimo TACO (siglas en inglés de \" Trump siempre se acobarda\") que se acuñó este año en Wall Street . Trump \"hace lo que promete\" Y entonces llegó el asalto sobre Caracas y la espectacular detención de Maduro para llevarlo ante la justicia estadounidense por supuesto narcoterrorismo . Ese mismo 3 de enero Trump aseguró al mundo en rueda de prensa que su país gobernaría Venezuela hasta que se complete una transición, mientras distintos miembros de su Administración subrayaron que Washington no permitirá que las Américas se conviertan en un refugio seguro para narcotraficantes, \"regímenes hostiles\" o potencias externas. \"Esto es un claro ejemplo de la determinación de demostrar al mundo que EE.UU. está decidido a usar la fuerza bruta para imponer su voluntad en todo el mundo, particularmente en las Américas. Y que no se ve limitado por las normas del derecho internacional o nacional ni por las normas de coexistencia pacífica con otros países\", explica a EFE el profesor de la American University y exdirector de su Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos y Latinos, Eric Hershberg . Un mes antes de capturar a Maduro la Casa Blanca había publicado su Estrategia de Seguridad Nacional , disipando cualquier duda sobre su nueva concepción del mundo. El documento, además de retratar a la Unión Europea (UE) como un socio problemático y esbozar un plan de injerencia que evite que la \"vieja civilización\" europea desaparezca víctima de la inmigración, insta a resucitar la \" doctrina Monroe \", que a principios del siglo XX concibió que el continente americano en su totalidad debía ser una...",

  "text": "El presidente del Partido de la Liberación Dominicana (PLD), Danilo Medina , advirtió este domingo que la República Dominicana atraviesa un momento de profunda incertidumbre económica e institucional, marcado por la falta de rumbo del Gobierno y por escándalos que involucran entidades clave del Estado como el Seguro Banreservas , el Banco Agrícola y el Seguro Nacional de Salud (Senasa). En ese contexto, Medina puso especial énfasis en los escándalos que afectan instituciones financieras y de seguridad social del Estado. \"Hay escándalos en el Seguro Banreservas , escándalos en el Banco Agrícola y los escándalos de Senasa, que parece que no se van a tocar. Escándalos por todas partes\", expresó. Tras encabezar una asamblea del PLD en San Pedro de Macorís , Medina fue abordado por la prensa local y nacional, a quienes expresó su preocupación por lo que definió como un deterioro progresivo de la economía y de la confianza ciudadana. \"Yo creo que el país luce sin rumbo. Es como si el gobierno hubiera perdido la dirección del Estado dominicano\", afirmó. El exmandatario enumeró una serie de indicadores que, a su juicio, reflejan la gravedad de la situación actual, entre ellos la caída del crecimiento económico, la reducción de la demanda y de las ventas, el aumento del endeudamiento público , el incremento del pago de intereses , el déficit fiscal y la subida generalizada de los precios. A esto sumó el presunto aumento de los actos de corrupción \"sin que se toque a ninguno de los responsables\". El líder del PLD criticó además lo que calificó como un \" relanzamiento cosmético \" del Gobierno, señalando que el reciente cambio de apenas tres funcionarios no constituye una transformación real ni una respuesta efectiva a la crisis de confianza que, según dijo, vive el país. \"No se ha hecho ningún cambio fundamental para relanzar el gobierno en este momento, y la gente está sumamente preocupada y llena de incertidumbre \", subrayó. Medina advirtió que esta situación ha impactado negativamente en el clima de inversión , al señalar que los actores económicos no tienen la convicción de que sea un momento oportuno para invertir. A ello agregó su preocupación ante la intención del Gobierno de impulsar una reforma fiscal , afirmando que ha perdido la autoridad moral para hacerlo en medio de escándalos y cuestionamientos institucionales.

Citó que para el presente año se contemplan alrededor de 400 mil millones de pesos en préstamos para equilibrar las finanzas públicas, lo que, según explicó, dispara aún más el pago de intereses . \"Estamos tomando dinero prestado para pagar intereses y...",

  "text": "La indignación internacional crece contra Grok , el asistente de inteligencia artificial ( IA ) de la red social X , que permite crear a partir de fotografías de personas reales imágenes de carácter sexual de mujeres y menores . Estos son los principales puntos de esta enésima polémica de la plataforma de Elon Musk . En bikini Grok , el chatbot desarrollado por la empresa estadounidense xAI , dispone de su propia cuenta en la red social X , lo que permite a los usuarios interactuar con él. Hasta la semana pasada, todos los internautas podían mencionar al bot en sus publicaciones para pedir la creación o la modificación de imágenes, que luego recibían como respuesta. Algunos aprovecharon este servicio para publicar o responder a mensajes con fotografías de mujeres, acompañándolas de órdenes como \" Ponle un bikini \" para obtener a cambio un montaje ultrarrealista (\"deepfake\" en inglés). Desde el 9 de enero , la función de creación de imágenes fue desactivada para los usuarios que no son de pago en la plataforma. Aunque ya existen dispositivos que permiten crear imágenes íntimas no consentidas con IA , Grok fue el primero en popularizar esta deriva integrándola directamente en una red social . El fenómeno se agravó con la aparición de fotografías trucadas en las que se incluía a menores . Algunos usuarios también utilizaron este bot para generar imágenes sexualizadas de las víctimas del incendio de Crans-Montana , en Suiza, y de la mujer asesinada a manos de la policía migratoria en Mineápolis a principios de enero. Un análisis realizado la semana pasada por la oenegé AI Forensics sobre más de 20,000 imágenes generadas por Grok reveló que más de la mitad representaban a personas con poca ropa, de las cuales el 81 % eran mujeres y el 2 % parecían menores . ¿Qué hicieron los gobiernos? Indonesia y Malasia suspendieron el acceso e India aseguró haber retirado miles de contenidos y eliminado cientos de cuentas. En Reino Unido , el regulador de seguridad en internet abrió el lunes una investigación contra la red social , que podría desembocar en una multa de hasta el 10 % de su facturación mundial. El organismo también podría recurrir a la justicia para bloquear la plataforma. El primer ministro británico, Keir Starmer , afirmó que \"si X no puede controlar a Grok , lo haremos nosotros, y lo haremos rápido\". En su opinión, reservar esta opción a los usuarios de pago \"convierte una funcionalidad que permite la creación de imágenes ilegales en un servicio premium \" y constituye \"una afrenta a las víctimas de la misoginia y de las violencias sexuales \". En Francia , la ministra a cargo de los asuntos digitales, Anne Le Hénanff , denunció una decisión \"insuficiente e hipócrita\", y declaró que \"si X puede desactivar esta funcionalidad para los que no están abonados, entonces puede hacerlo para todos\". La UE anunció haber impuesto a X una medida cautelar a raíz del escándalo . \"No externalizaremos la...",

  "text": "【本報消息】澳門基金會與三聯書店（香港）合作出版的「澳門知識叢書」，以通俗文字與豐富圖片，向公眾及旅客介紹澳門豐富的本土文化。近日，該叢書推出由劉偉博士撰寫之新著《澳門與馬禮遜》，深入梳理澳門在近代中西文化交流中的獨特角色，現已於港澳地區同步發行。自開埠以來，澳門匯聚了眾多影響深遠的歷史人物。十九世紀初，英國新教傳教士羅伯特．馬禮遜（Robert Morrison，1782-1834）來華傳教，於澳門長期居住達25年。在清朝閉關與禁教的背景下，他透過編纂字典、翻譯《聖經》、興辦教育、創辦報刊及設立醫館等方式，開創了間接傳教的新途徑。這些工作不僅推動了基督教在華的傳播，更實質促進了中西文化之交融，而澳門正是這些歷史活動的重要舞台。本書作者劉偉擁有南京師範大學文學博士（新聞學）及文學碩士（傳播學）學位，並為南京大學公共管理碩士、英國伯恩茅斯大學傳媒學院訪問學者，曾出版專著《馬禮遜對華傳播活動研究》，現任職於江蘇省宣傳系統。劉偉透過大量史料，系統呈現馬禮遜在澳門的活動與其所處時代。書中詳細剖析他來華的背景、家庭生活、在醫學、教育等領域的貢獻，為讀者展開一段生動的歷史畫卷。「澳門知識叢書」至今...",

Sure, everyone loves history, and the Supreme Court is into it these days. But do we have too much of it floating around the constitutional law world?

Then we shift to judges and their busy schedules. What’s up with judges not reading briefs before an argument? Is it really all that bad? How prepared must a judge be to be a “prepared judge”?

Huit jours de navigation dans les glaces auront été nécessaires pour s’approcher du continent et rejoindre la polynie (espace d’eau libre) devant la station Dumont d’Urville (DDU). Devant DDU, L’Astrolabe a dû effectuer du « ramming », une méthode de pilonnage de la banquise, afin de se rapprocher au maximum de la station. Dans l’anse du Lion, zone de déchargement de la station polaire française, L’Astrolabe a pu débuter les opérations logistiques via l’hélicoptère du bord et délivrer 340 m3 de combustible. Ce combustible résistant au froid, appelé SAB, est un élément central de la logistique polaire, permettant d’assurer le fonctionnement des générateurs électriques de la station. Propriété des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises (TAAF), et mis en œuvre et entretenu par la Marine nationale, L’Astrolabe est un navire brise-glace né d’un partenariat conclu entre les TAAF, la Marine nationale et l’Institut polaire français (IPEV). Le navire s’appuie sur deux équipages d’une vingtaine de marins qui le mettent en œuvre alternativement pour réaliser des missions de soutien à la logistique en Antarctique et des missions de souveraineté dans la zone maritime du sud de l’océan Indien, particulièrement dans les terres australes et antarctiques françaises.",

The further we went, the more people there were. At first we were on the sidewalks, then gradually we merged to take over the entire street. To begin with, no one was chanting; it was as if we were all waiting for the crowd to grow larger. Suddenly, about two rows ahead of us, a woman around 60 years old shouted, “Death to the dictator,” and all of us joined in. Everyone was shouting with all their strength, “Death to the dictator,” “Death to Khamenei” and “Freedom, freedom.” I went to different places in the city centre and in most, after the crowd warmed up, chants like “Long live the Shah” and “Pahlavi will return” were also heard. Being together like this in the street was very beautiful. Together we were magnificent and dignified. Shoulder to shoulder, we moved forward, believing in our steps. There were also people who didn’t chant and you could tell they had different political views, but they walked along with everyone else. We were united and no one pushed out of line, no one argued. That first day, security forces were lined up in groups of 30 or 40 but didn’t dare approach the mass of people. They were wearing black or camouflage uniforms with helmets and all were armed; mostly, as far as I saw, with pellet and paintball guns. But they also had pistols and Kalashnikovs. All kinds of people were in the crowd. There were many women, mostly unveiled, but also some with a loosely worn scarf and other even fully veiled. Most people had come out with family members or friends. We often saw teenagers with their parents and even their grandparents. We rarely saw people alone, and if so they would quickly join a group and stay with them. In an alley leading to the main street, a woman about 50 years old locked her front door, came into the alley, and started walking toward the main street. At first she was ahead of us; after a few steps she joined us and we went together. There were many people aged 60 and older. It seemed that the lower, middle, and affluent classes had all come out together. Morale was excellent. Then they started killing people. On Friday, January 9, on Shariati Street, we had just separated from the crowd and were heading home. It was 9 pm. I went into a bakery, and when I came out with bread in my hands, I saw a plainclothes agent pointing his gun at my brother’s chest and shouting, “Go home!” I was so scared that I could only scream. We ran toward our home a few alleys away when we saw several agents coming from the other side of the street. This time one of them aimed his...",

  "text": "IWPR Institute for War & Peace Reporting Friday, 16 January, 2026 Share via facebook Share via twitter Share via linkedin The link has been copied Share via email Welcome to IWPR’s Frontline Update, your go-to source to hear from journalists and local voices at the front lines of conflict. THE BIG PICTURE The mass protests in Iran, with thousands killed in a regime crackdown, are presenting the greatest challenge to the authorities in many years. As an internet blackout severely restricts the media’s ability to report from within the country, we hear a first-hand account from a protestor in Tehran. VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE “The city feels as if a pall of death has been cast over it,” wrote the man, who asked to stay anonymous for his own security. He described a joyous atmosphere when he joined the protests on January 8, with crowds of young and old, men and women, religious and secular all mixed together. Many chanted for the fall of the regime, others for freedom, while simply walked along in silence and solidarity. “Being together like this in the street was very beautiful. Together we were magnificent and dignified. Shoulder to shoulder, we moved forward, believing in our steps,” he wrote. “Morale was excellent. Then they started killing people.” He described how plainclothes agents roamed the city, armed with pistols and Kalashnikovs, targeting ordinary people. “A friend saw with his own eyes how agents collected the bodies of those killed in eastern Tehran and piled them all together in the middle of the square, without even putting them in body bags. The dead were still in their bloody clothes; it was as if they just wanted to clear them from the street so traffic could pass. A few people tried to approach the bodies, and they were shot dead on the spot.” WHY IT MATTERS The nation-wide protests erupted in response to the collapse of Iran’s national currency, following the impact of last summer’s 12-day war with Israel as well as UN sanctions reintroduced in September 2024 that added to the huge burden of ongoing US measures. This dire economic situation has only worsened in recent weeks. But the demonstrations were also spurred by widespread frustration at the regime’s repressive social and political policies, and the bloody response has only served to further deepen dissent. “The government has mobilised against the people and unleashed a bloodbath,” the Tehran protestor wrote. “It has never been like this before.” THE BOTTOM LINE Speaking up in the face of repression takes extraordinary bravery, and the message of the courageous people of Iran must be heard. Their voices matter, their lives matter, and despite media repression their fight for dignity, freedom and justice still resonates around the world. IWPR stands in solidarity with those seeking freedom and a future in which their rights, dreams and humanity are fully respected.

  "text": "Veniamin Trubachov War correspondent Tuesday, 13 January, 2026 Share via facebook Share via twitter Share via linkedin The link has been copied Share via email In the morning of January 9 2025, near the village of Guyevo in Russia’s Kursk region, a burst of automatic rifle fire rang out and two Ukrainian soldiers fell to the ground. Viktor Liapota and Ivan Kondratiuk, fighters with the 41st Separate Territorial Defence Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, had been captured after a firefight with a Russian reconnaissance and sabotage group. “After temporarily seizing the dugout, the occupiers led the prisoners into an open area and shot them in the back with automatic rifles,” the subsequent investigation by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) report stated. Two days later, during a counterattack in the same area, Ukrainian forces captured several Russian soldiers. Among them there was Vladimir Ivanov, a rifleman from the 40th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces who investigators allege was among those who participated in the execution of the two Ukrainian POWs. Ivanov was transferred to a Ukrainian detention facility and subsequently notified of a suspicion against him under Article 28, Part 1 and Article 438, Part 2 of the criminal code of Ukraine concerning the violation of the laws and customs of war. Hearings in the case are currently underway at the Shevchenkivskyi district court in Kyiv. As Ukrainian courts prosecute a number of Russian servicemen accused of executing POWs, law enforcement agencies argue that such crimes are systemic and that not only the direct perpetrators but also their commanders be held to account. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the execution of Ukrainian POWs has been documented across the entire front line: in Donetsk, Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine as well as in Russia’s Kursk region. “Prosecutorial authorities have overseen 105 criminal proceedings related to the murder of 337 Ukrainian servicemen of the Defence Forces of Ukraine who had unconditionally laid down their arms and/or surrendered,” a spokesperson for the prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine told IWPR. These are only the official cases that Ukrainian investigators have been able to confirm; the actual number could be significantly higher. Nine Russian servicemen have been charged in connection with the killing of Ukrainian POWs. Indictments against six of these individuals have been sent to court: three have since been convicted, while the trials for the other three are ongoing. “Every case against Russian servicemen is significant and it is crucial to investigate them not as isolated incidents but to prove the systemic and widespread nature of the crimes in court,” Andrii Yakovliev, an international humanitarian law specialist, told IWPR. “We see crimes committed. We see that these crimes are not isolated. “We see that these crimes are committed in different parts of the front and this process involves a large number of people at various levels of the military hierarchy,” he continued, adding that “these are all facts that lead...",

  "text": "Tetyana Dotsyak Kharkiv-based TV Correspondent Tuesday, 13 January, 2026 Share via facebook Share via twitter Share via linkedin The link has been copied Share via email A Russian citizen acting as “police chief” for the occupation authorities has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for brutalising villagers in the Kharkiv region. Vladimir Samoilov, a Russian citizen originally from Belgorod, was convicted of abuses including beating victims with a taser and a wooden mallet as well as so-called waterboarding, in which water is poured continuously onto a towel over a person’s face, simulating the feeling of drowning. The court heard how, on the first day of the full-scale invasion, the Russian army occupied the Lyptsi community on the border of the Kharkiv region. Russian forces positioned rocket launchers between civilian homes so as to shell Saltivka, a northern district of Kharkiv. The occupying forces unleashed a reign of terror in the border villages, which law enforcement officers began to they were blue, so they tried to rub them,” the witness said. “Then they took him for interrogation and we could hear them beating him. I saw his injuries; they tortured him with a taser. [The victim] had cancer and needed to eat something every 2-3 hours, but he had no such opportunity. He was also denied any medication. These conditions of detention negatively impacted his health. Then he was taken away somewhere; they said to Belgorod.” Another victim was a man identified as 68-year-old Mr S. On August 14, 2022, approximately 15 Russian fighters arrived in an armoured personnel carrier at his home in Lyptsi. They bound his hands behind his back, hooded him and took him to a torture chamber in the basement of an apartment building in Strilecha. Investigators state that in this chamber Samoilov personally guarded the detainees and regularly abused them. “On one of the days (the exact date was not established during the pre-trial investigation) between August 14, 2022 and September 12, 2022 V.= Samoilov ran into the cell and began striking Mr S with a rubber truncheon because he had called representatives of the Luhansk People’s Republic (‘LPR’) ‘Gestapo agents’,” the indictment read. As Samoilov had lived in the area, he could identify pro-Ukrainian residents and military veterans not only in his own village but in neighbouring ones as well. The investigation found that this was why occupying administration appointed him as a de facto policeman, with his specific role as the chief of the so-called district officers for the occupied Lyptsi community. During the counteroffensive by the armed forces of Ukraine, Samoilov managed to escape to Russian territory and was therefore charged in absentia. Samoilov was tried at the Derhachi district court of the Kharkiv Region, the notice of suspicion and court summons having been published on the official website of the prosecutor general’s office and in the Uriadovyi Kurier newspaper. In accordance with the requirements for a fair trial in absentia, Samoilov was appointed a state-funded public defender. The court examined the...",

  "title": "Turkey: The Return of the Women’s Matinee",
  "text": "Meltem Suat Contributor Tuesday, 13 January, 2026 Share via facebook Share via twitter Share via linkedin The link has been copied Share via email The heavy gates of a seemingly ordinary wedding hall close on a busy street in Istanbul. The city’s bustle is shut out, replaced by the throbbing bass indoors. With her chic headscarf and sequin dress, Tuğba Dağlar stands at the DJ booth. To kick off the evening, she reads out a manifesto to the hundreds of women standing in the hall. “Leave your identity, your motherhood, your career, your marital issues beyond those doors. Here we are just women – and we are going to have a raging good time!” With that, the hall is turned into a temporary sovereign republic, one detached from the harsh realities of everyday life and where men are not admitted. The lights are dimmed, headscarves come off, mini-skirts and party dresses emerge from under long robes. As DJ Tuğba calls it, this is a “no-men-fly zone”. The kadınlar matinesi (women’s matinee), once a staple of city life in Turkey, has revived in recent years. It’s not simply a matter of changing tastes. Women who can’t find space for themselves in public, discouraged by the lack of security in parks and high prices in cafes, are building their own “underground cities” in halls with no windows. Today, events are attended by thousands of women ranging from bank executives to cleaners. For some, they’re a kind of mass therapy session – and business is booming. Matinees date back to the great rural-to-urban migrations of the 1970s and 80s, and the slums that formed on the outskirts of Istanbul. Afternoon dance parties that played traditional Arabesque music were a safe haven for women who wanted to hold on to their roots. Today, dance beats and up-tempo pop songs have replaced the anguished longing of Arabesque, but they serve the same purpose: to provide a space where women caught between modern urban life and traditional values can be themselves. A housewife before starting her DJ career, Dağlar started organising all-female events with her friends nine years ago. “I saw that women want a space without men, that belongs entirely to women,” she said, explaining that in times past most of the staff at the dance halls were men, which meant women found it difficult to let go. The new wave of matinees reflects other changes in society, too. “We used to hold matinees on weekdays and housewives would show up. Now we hold them at weekends, because 90 per cent of the attendees are working women,” said veteran organiser Kahraman Pehlivan. “Bank directors, top level executives, branch managers – everyone’s here.” Selin K, a 34-year old banker, wears two-piece suits for her high-rise office job during the week. But on Saturdays, she dances her night away at the matinee. “I have to be strong, serious and controlled at the office,” Selin says. “I’m always on edge when I go to mixed-gender venues, looking to...",

  "text": "IWPR Institute for War & Peace Reporting Friday, 9 January, 2026 Share via facebook Share via twitter Share via linkedin The link has been copied Share via email Welcome to IWPR’s Frontline Update, your go-to source to hear from journalists and local voices at the front lines of conflict. THE BIG PICTURE As global attention focuses on Latin America in the wake of the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Madura, IWPR is launching a dedicated platform to showcase some of the region’s best investigative journalism produced with IWPR support. Published in both English and Spanish , the IWPR.latam site highlights how local independent media are holding authoritarian governments and corrupt actors to account, amid political unrest, widespread graft and chronic economic crises. VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE “The events in Venezuela over the weekend, together with the US government’s renewed focus on Latin America, underscore the importance of ensuring that local voices are heard and that those in power are held to account through independent scrutiny and investigation,” said Dhaniella Falk, IWPR director for Latin America and the Caribbean. Since 2020, IWPR has been supporting journalists and outlets to counter increasing media repression across Latin America and carry out groundbreaking fact-based reporting. Stories supported by IWPR have won multiple awards, including in Venezuela, where partners have played a critical role in exposing corruption within the Maduro regime, including links to narcotrafficking and other illicit economies. One partner, Armando.Info, has been among the most prolific outlets reporting on abuses, from the use of torture houses in Caracas to illicit gold trafficking and links between Venezuela and the militant Hizbollah group. WHY IT MATTERS Independent journalism is essential to revealing human rights abuses against independent thought and dissent; the efforts are particularly effective when media is supported by civil society actors. In Venezuela, as elsewhere in the region, IWPR has supported this powerful nexus as a key driver of change. The C-Informa alliance, for instance, brought together independent Venezuelan media and digital rights groups to expose propaganda networks associated with the regime, winning the Inter American Press Association Prize for Journalism Excellence for a story that revealed how the Maduro government was exploiting Instagram to malign the opposition . “Civil society organisations have played a vital role in sustaining hope for freedom and democracy among Venezuelans, while media have kept the people informed of regime abuses. Both are well positioned -and could make a decisive contribution - to a more prosperous, just and stable future for the country now that Maduro is out,” said Falk. THE BOTTOM LINE Despite corruption, malign influence and other complex challenges to democracy, Latin American civil society and media have demonstrated their resilience and ability to hold powerful criminals to account. As the region faces further turbulence, we continue to support brave local voices as they carry out their essential work.

  "title": "On the road to the India AI Impact Summit: Global AI governance and the HAIP Reporting Framework",
  "text": "At its May 2023 Hiroshima Summit, the Group of Seven (G7) launched the Hiroshima AI Process (HAIP) in response to the rapid proliferation of generative AI models. The HAIP aims to promote transparency around the opportunities and risks presented by advanced AI systems and serve as a forum for collaboration on governance challenges. In February 2025, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established a reporting framework that provides a mechanism for organizations developing advanced AI systems to voluntarily report on their risk mitigation practices, intending to facilitate cross-organizational comparability and to identify and disseminate good practices. The first round of reports were submitted and published by the OECD in April of last year. On January 22, the Brookings Institution and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) will host a public discussion on global AI governance, transparency mechanisms and monitoring. The discussion, organized in the lead-up to the India AI Impact Summit , will open with introductory remarks by Indian Ambassador H.E. Vinay Mohan Kwatra, setting out India’s priorities for responsible and trustworthy AI. Brookings and CDT experts will then present findings from a new report on the HAIP Reporting Framework, assessing how this first-of-its-kind, voluntary reporting mechanism is shaping transparency and risk mitigation for advanced AI systems, and areas for improvement. Following the report presentation, a multi-stakeholder panel of government officials, multilateral representatives, and civil society will discuss lessons from the first HAIP reporting cycle, practical approaches to AI transparency and monitoring, and how voluntary reporting can complement global AI governance approaches and inform the agenda of the India AI Impact Summit. A subsequent panel will feature industry representatives and explore the value of voluntary transparency reporting and how industry can support these efforts. Finally, a fireside chat will delve into NIST’s efforts to begin building toward standards for model documentation and transparency through its “Zero Drafts” pilot project. Online viewers can submit questions via e-mail to [email protected] .",

  "title": "The Oxford Handbook of Norms Research in International Relations",
  "text": "Norms research in international relations has developed sufficiently over the past thirty-five years to become its own sub-discipline within the field. It has its own corresponding ‘toolbox’ of concepts, approaches, and methods which have often resulted from debates representing distinct perspectives on how norms matter for IR as a field and for global international relations more generally. Even so, three groups of enduring questions continue to sit at the heart of norms research: first, the processes by which norms emerge, change or disappear, on the one hand, and by which they are contested, violated, diffused, or replaced on the other; second, the agency of actors at sites on the macro-, meso-, or micro-scale of global order, and who engages with these processes; and third, the embeddedness or interaction of norms with other pre-existing norms and structures such as the prevailing rules of engagement and clusters of normative meaning. The Oxford Handbook of Norms Research in International Relations provides a state-of-the-art overview of past, current, and future norms research in International Relations. It provides a comprehensive overview of the toolbox that has developed over this time, mapping the field’s development based on key conceptual milestones, notable theoretical moves, and developments with regard to the field’s contribution to social science theory development on the one hand and politics and policymaking in world politics on the other.",

  "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — A collaboration between Princeton University engineers and entomologists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign began with the researchers chasing grasshoppers in a hot parking lot. Their eventual focus on the hindwings of one species of grasshopper, Schistocerca americana , the American grasshopper, is inspiring a new approach to untethered gliding flight. A study of grasshopper hindwings inspired the design of small gliders. Photo by Princeton University/Sameer A. Khan/Fotobuddy The scientists detail their findings in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Study principle investigator Aimy Wissa , a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton, teamed up with U. of I. entomology professor Marianne Alleyne , whose laboratory uses insects as model organisms for discovering attributes that may be advantageous in engineering applications. The researchers were fascinated by the grasshoppers’ ability to glide for extended distances using very little energy, Alleyne said. U. of I. entomology professor Marianne Alleyne uses insects as model organisms for discovering attributes that may be advantageous in engineering applications. Photo courtesy Marianne Alleyne “Grasshoppers have two pairs of wings,” she said. “The forewings are very leathery and are mostly used to protect the hindwings, which can fold. It is the membranous hindwings that are large and can flap and help with gliding.” “Gliding is a mode of cheap flight,” Wissa said. “When we want to produce thrust, we flap. When we want to conserve energy, we fully deploy the wings and glide.” The researchers observed that the grasshoppers spread their wings to glide, but the wings were not flat when spread. They were corrugated. “As an entomologist, I was mostly interested in what the benefits of this corrugation might be,” Alleyne said. “I was wondering if corrugation is a disadvantage, or if it might be a neutral trait that came about to allow them to fold their wings. Corrugation also could be beneficial. We didn’t know.” Princeton University mechanical and aerospace engineering professor and study principal investigator Aimy Wissa, with Princeton Ph.D. candidate Kyung Jun Paul Lee. Photo by Princeton University/Sameer A. Khan/Fotobuddy The engineers and the biologists worked together to uncover the grasshoppers’ secret to efficient gliding locomotion. They took CT scans of the grasshopper wings. This technique uses X-rays and computing to capture the detailed geometry of an object. Insights from their analyses allowed them to 3D-print model wings and to test whether corrugation, wing shape or the curvature of the wing surfaces contributed to efficient gliding flight. The Princeton team evaluated the aerodynamic performance of their gliders both in a water chamber and by launching them across the Princeton Robotics Laboratory. Researchers at Princeton University tested the aerodynamic qualities of various gliders, each with wings mimicking unique features of the grasshopper hindwing. Photo by Princeton University/Sameer A. Khan/Fotobuddy While corrugation of the wings helped with lift, the best-performing gliders were smooth, not corrugated, the team found. Future research will focus on how to incorporate the corrugations to enable wing folding while still maximizing gliding efficiency, the researchers said....",

  "title": "Medications could help the aging brain cope with surgery, memory impairment",
  "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Simple pharmaceutical interventions could help older brains cope with memory impairment and recovery after surgery, new studies in mice suggest. In two studies, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign investigated different aspects of cognitive impairment: postoperative impairment — a relatively common phenomenon among older adults — and age-related memory decline, as well as noninvasive methods of restoring function. “These studies provide a blueprint for further basic science studies that can identify compounds in preclinical tests that may eventually also be testable in humans,” said research leader Uwe Rudolph , professor and head of comparative biosciences at the U. of I. The first paper, published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined the problem of post-surgical cognitive impairment. Immediately after surgery, cognitive impairment is common, but studies have found that 10% of adults over the age of 60 still have deficits to learning, memory and executive function three months after surgery, Rudolph said. “If you then multiply that by the number of surgeries that are done on people 60 years and over, the number is very significant,” he said. Propofol is a common anesthetic agent that has shown promise in other mouse studies for improving cognition in Alzheimer’s disease models, though in high doses it may harm the brain, Rudolph said. To study whether propofol could help with cognition after surgery, the researchers performed surgery on older mice — an approach not as common as it may seem. “Other studies have been done on younger mice, or they used older mice and put them under anesthesia but did not perform surgery. That makes it hard to separate what is attributable to the anesthesia and what is due to the trauma of the surgery itself,” said Illinois postdoctoral researcher Rajasekar Nagarajan , the first author of both studies. The Illinois team found that intermittent administration of propofol, beginning before surgery, increased mouse performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks after the surgery. And the results lasted five days after a dose, even though propofol is thought to be cleared from the body in a matter of hours. Looking closely at what was happening in the mouse brains, the researchers found that mice who were administered propofol had a long-lasting increase of certain receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA, a key regulator of learning and memory, on the surface of neurons in the hippocampus region of the brain and decreased markers for inflammation and cell death. Mice who were not administered propofol did not have these molecular changes. “It is well known that general anesthesia and surgery may result in cognitive impairments, especially in older individuals. It is surprising and interesting that a general anesthetic like propofol actually can improve cognitive function after surgery in aged individuals,” Nagarajan said. “We are currently doing experiments with a compound that specifically increases the activity of the GABA receptor subtype that is increased after a single administration of propofol. Such a compound may help prevent postoperative cognitive deficits and potentially could be useful...",

  "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. ­— The first year of President Trump’s second term has ushered in host of policy changes to higher education, research funding and priorities. Kelvin Droegemeier , professor of climate, meteorology and atmospheric science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 2019 to 2021. He now serves as the special advisor to the chancellor for science and policy at the U. of I. He spoke with News Bureau biomedical sciences editor Liz Ahlberg Touchstone about the policy changes and what value science and research have to the nation. Why does the government have a hand in funding academic research? Can’t private companies, foundations and philanthropists cover it? It’s important to distinguish among the types of research and the funding for them. The spectrum runs from curiosity-driven, basic, fundamental research to applied work and product development. Private companies invest in research for one reason: to improve their bottom line. And that’s appropriate. Although private companies fund almost as much basic research as the government, they understandably do so in areas specific to their business interests. Private companies will not invest in research just for the sake of understanding. That’s where the government comes in. Because fundamental research, by design, has no immediately clear commercial benefit, only the government is positioned to fund it; private companies won’t take the risk. Yet fundamental research is the starting point for most things we enjoy today. Thus, the beauty of America’s research ecosystem is that each sector — government, industry, academia, nonprofits and philanthropy — funds research relative to its specific institutional characteristics. Our multisector research and development system is unique in the world and the envy of the world. That’s what’s made us the global leader in research and development. We talk about global leadership in science and technology — but remember that when you have that leadership, you are at the table, driving the conversation in policies of things like ethical use of artificial intelligence. If we lose our position of technological leadership, will we lose the ability to be at the table, setting those global standards for ethical behavior, use, policies and things like that? What kind of value does taxpayer-funded research have for the average American? For the country as a whole? The thing that is most important to me is how our American values comport with our research values. Openness, transparency, accountability, honesty, integrity — research can’t happen without these things. They’re baked into the process by which we do research, and they also are consistent with American values. Taxpayers provide funding to the government that then is provided to researchers through grants and contracts. An important point that is often overlooked is that the government provides that funding because research is a public good. It’s not just a private good for private companies. It’s a public good that provides benefit back to the taxpayers in the form of national security, economic benefits and quality of life. Then, of...",

Ethnic and regional parties claimed the remaining 12 seats as follows: Naga National Party (3 seats in Sagaing) Pa-O National Organization (3 in Shan) National Unity Party (2 in Magwe and Ayeyarwady) Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party (SNDP) (1 in Shan) Mon Unity Party (1 in Mon) Shan-ni Solidarity Party (1 in Shan) Rakhine Nationalities Party (1 in Rakhine) The commission also counted 14 uncontested constituencies included in phases 2 and 3, bringing the total to 116 Lower House seats. Of these, 13 went to the USDP and the SNDP won in Shan State’s Mongnai. Overall, the USDP has won 103 of the 116 Lower House seats called so far. Upper House results As of Jan. 8, the UEC reported 31 confirmed seats in the Upper House. The USDP won 21, while ethnic parties took the rest: Zomi National Party (3 seats) Arakan Front Party (3 seats) Rakhine Nationalities Party, Naga National Party, Wa National Party and Mon Unity Party (1 seat each). State and regional assemblies By Jan. 7, the UEC had confirmed 135 seats in state and regional assemblies. The USDP won 108, while ethnic and local parties shared the remainder: Arakan Front Party (5 seats) Zomi National Party, Naga National Party, and Rakhine Nationalities Party (4 seats each) Pa-O National Organization and National Unity Party (3 seats each) People’s Party (PP), Shan-ni Solidarity Party, New Chinland Congress and Akha National Development Party (one seat each) Key figures and defeats Almost all USDP leaders and junta ministers who took part in the Dec. 28 vote secured victories. They include party chairman Khin Yi, vice chairman Myat Hein, Naypyitaw chair Hla Swe, hardliner Maung Myint, Information Minister Maung Maung Ohn, Transport and Communications Minister Mya Tun Oo, Health Minister Dr. Thet Khaing Win and junta Electricity Commission chair and President’s Office Minister Tin Aung San. However, not all prominent figures prevailed. Former Bureau of Special Operations 2 chief and current Shan State Chief Minister Aung Aung lost in Taunggyi to the Pa-O National Organization, while former deputy information minister and current USDP secretary Pike Htwe was defeated in Magwe’s Taungdwingyi by the National Unity Party—a successor to the Burma Socialist Programme Party through which Myanmar’s first military dictator Ne Win ruled the country for decades. In Rakhine State, well-known ethnic politicians Dr. Aye Maung and U Ba Shein lost to USDP candidates....",

  "text": "The Union Election Commission shows no sign of taking action over mounting complaints of advance voting irregularities in the junta-organized election, offering only assurances that procedures will improve in the remaining rounds. At a meeting in Naypyitaw on Monday, political parties contesting the three-phase election raised complaints about irregularities in advance voting for the first phase, citing a lack of transparency and failure to follow electoral law. The UEC promised improvements in the remaining phases 2 and 3, but party representatives said the body made no commitment to investigate or address problems that occurred in Phase 1, for which official results have already been released. January 13, 2026 27 January 13, 2026 157 January 12, 2026 677 The first phase was held on the ground in 102 townships on Dec. 28 and was predictably won by the junta’s proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which took as many as 90 percent in the lower house, upper house and regional and state parliaments. After their wipeout, the other parties complained that the USDP is fiddling the advance vote again—like it did in the heavily rigged 2010 election. Advance voting took place in October and November, and overseas voting in early December. Candidates complained that they were not informed when absentee ballots arrived in their constituencies and were denied the right to observe the count. They also complained of irregularities in the way votes were handled. “In my township, we received no notice at all” when or how advance votes were collected, said one candidate from Yangon. Citing the observably low voter turnout in many constituencies, he said he is suspicious that no-shows were counted as advance votes. Kyaw Soe, a candidate from the Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party (SNDP) contesting Bago Region’s Yedashe Township on social media called the process “unfair” and “unilateral.” “I totally reject it,” he said. “We were not told when ballots would be counted, and none of our representatives took part in sealing the ballots.” Under election law, township election commissions must notify candidates when advance ballots from outside their constituencies arrive, keep them at the township police station, and count them in front of party representatives. As for the collection of advance ballots from inside their constituencies, candidates are entitled to monitor the process. But contesting parties said these regulations were not followed. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Ye Tun, the chair of the 88 Generation Student Youths Party, said: “Almost every party reported irregularities they had experienced. The UEC promised improvements in Phases 2 and 3.” Bago Region’s election commission chair said instructions have now been issued requiring advance ballots to arrive before 6 a.m. on polling day, and that late arrivals will be excluded from the count. But election law requires advance ballots to reach the respective township election commissions no later than 4 p.m. two whole days before polling day. Hnin Hnin Hmwe, a joint general secretary of the Democratic Party for a New Society (DPNS), described the advance vote as a tool the...",

  "text": "The second phase of the controversial election organized by the military regime is set to take place on Sunday, Jan. 11, covering 100 townships across 12 states and regions. Senior junta officials, leaders of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) and several well-known political figures are among the candidates. With its administration having collapsed in much of the country, especially in ethnic states and central Myanmar, the regime has split the polls into three phases. The first round was held on Dec. 28 in 102 townships, where the USDP claimed nearly 90 percent of the seats. The third phase is scheduled for Jan. 25. Where voting will take place According to the junta-appointed Union Election Commission, the second phase will be conducted in the following areas under junta control in northern, southern, central and eastern Myanmar: January 11, 2026 17 January 11, 2026 122 January 11, 2026 220 Kachin (3 townships) Karenni (2) Karen (2) Sagaing (11) Tanintharyi (3) Bago (12) Magwe (11) Mandalay (9) Mon (5) Yangon (16) Shan (17) Ayeyarwady (9) Parties and c andidates The USDP will contest most constituencies in the second phase of the election. Other parties include the National Unity Party, Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party, Myanmar Farmers Development Party, People’s Pioneer Party, People’s Party, Kachin State People’s Party, Tai-Leng Nationalities Development Party, New Democracy Party (Kachin), Lisu National Development Party, Kayah State People’s Party. Independent candidates are also running. Prominent figures running under the USDP banner in the second phase include: Nyo Saw : The junta’s prime minister and member of the military-dominated National Defense and Security Council. A former lieutenant general, Nyo Saw is running in Yangon’s Cocokyun Township. A trusted advisor to Min Aung Hlaing, Nyo Saw also chairs military conglomerate Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. In other words, he is the supremo of the Myanmar military’s business empire, playing a key role in financing the military regime. He is also a key figure in family businesses run by Min Aung Hlaing’s son and daughter. Nyo Saw also chairs a number of junta committees including those overseeing foreign policy and economic affairs, prompting speculation that he will be entrusted with a key position in the new “elected” government. Cocokyun, dominated by military families and civil servants, has long been a safe seat for the USDP. Min Aung Hlaing himself visited the township in October, urging voters to support candidates with “defense-minded” views. Khin Maung Soe : The party’s chair in Yangon, who served as electricity minister under Thein Sein’s quasi-civilian government, is contesting a Lower House seat in Yangon’s Hlegu, where he lost to a National League for Democracy (NLD) candidate in the 2020 general election. The hardliner is known for organizing pro-military rallies before and after the 2021 military coup.

  "text": "China’s ambitious South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the world’s largest water transfer scheme at approximately 500-700 billion yuan (over US$70 billion) in investment, poses escalating risks to Bangladesh and Southeast Asian nations by fundamentally altering flow patterns in shared rivers including the Brahmaputra and Mekong. Conceived by Mao Zedong in 1952 after a visit to the Yellow River, the project reflects China’s fundamental geographic water imbalance: the Yangtze River Basin and southern regions account for over 80 percent of China’s national water runoff but contain only 35 percent of cultivated land, while northern basins account for only six percent of runoff but 40 percent of cultivated land. After nearly half a century of analysis and comparison across more than 50 proposals, China finalized a three-route diversion scheme . The eastern route, completed in 2013, diverts 14.8 billion cubic meters annually from the lower Yangtze using existing channels, including the ancient Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal. The central route, completed in 2014, transfers 13 billion cubic meters from the Danjiankou Reservoir northward through gravitational flow to Beijing and Tianjin, supplying 19 major cities and over 100 counties. When fully operational, these two routes will collectively transfer approximately 27.8 billion cubic meters annually to northern China. January 10, 2026 381 January 9, 2026 455 January 8, 2026 361 It is the western route that presents serious transboundary consequences. Designed to transfer 17 billion cubic meters annually, it diverts water from the Yangtze and its tributaries (including the Tongtian, Yalong and Dadu) across the Bayan Har Mountains watershed through tunnel excavation. However, research by China’s water science establishment indicates expanded proposals that also target the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra), Lancang (Mekong) and Salween rivers originating on the Tibetan Plateau. The state-owned China South-to-North Water Diversion Company reported that by December 2024, the completed eastern and central routes had cumulatively diverted over 750 billion cubic meters since operations started—an extraordinary hydrological manipulation. Construction is projected to take another 40-50 years for full completion of all three routes. Bangladesh’s existential water vulnerability Bangladesh confronts transboundary water insecurity as an existential challenge rather than a policy matter. The UN notes that 90 percent of the nation’s water resources originate outside its borders . In a fundamental asymmetry, Bangladesh contributes none of the upstream areas yet depends entirely on downstream flows for agricultural production, fisheries and drinking water. Recent research documents the concrete impact of upstream interventions on Bangladesh’s delta. According to the UN Environment Programme and international sediment specialists, if Bangladesh wants to offset rising sea levels, the “principal nature-based solution” is the unabated delivery of the Ganges-Brahmaputra’s sediment load of approximately 1 billion tons per year. And this faces catastrophic risk from proposed upstream dams and diversions. For a nation where the delta constitutes over 80 percent of habitable territory and where “the implementation of currently proposed dams and diversions would preclude such opportunities” for natural sustenance, this is an existential threat.

  "text": "The Myanmar military’s proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) has secured the majority of parliamentary seats in Rakhine and Chin states, after benefiting from advance votes and proportional representation (PR) tallies in elections held under heavy restrictions. In Rakhine State, where voting was only held in three of 17 townships, the USDP won 19 seats. The regime was only able to organize elections in Manaung Township and urban areas in Sittwe and Kyaukphyu; the 14 other townships are now controlled by the ethnic Arakan Army. The three townships saw first-past-the-post (FPTP) contests with the USDP securing two of three seats in the Lower House (Pyithu Hluttaw), while the Rakhine Nationalities Party (RNP) took one. In the Upper House (Amyotha Hluttaw), the USDP again claimed two seats, with the Arakan Front Party (AFP) winning one. In the Rakhine State Assembly, the USDP secured two seats and the AFP one. January 9, 2026 642 January 9, 2026 642 January 8, 2026 764 When seats for all of Rakhine State were allocated under the PR system based on results from those three townships, the USDP got nine of 17 seats in the Rakhine State Assembly, with the RNP and AFP each taking four. In the Upper House, the USDP gained three of six seats, the AFP two, and the RNP one. The USDP also captured the ethnic Chin affairs minister post in the Rakhine legislature. In Chin State’s nine townships, elections were held only in Tedim and Hakha towns due to armed conflicts. The USDP won both Lower House seats, while in the Upper House, the USDP and Zomi National Party (ZNP) took one seat each. The Chin State Assembly also saw one seat each go to the USDP and ZNP. PR allocations gave the USDP four of six Upper House seats, with the ZNP taking two. In the nine-seat State Assembly, the USDP won five, the ZNP three, and the Chin State Congress Party one. Advance voting—manipulation of which by the previous regime delivered the USDP a decisive victory in the 2010 general election, boycotted by the pro-democracy parties—also boosted USDP candidates. The junta’s Chin Chief Minister Vungh Suan Thang, who contested a Lower House seat in Hakha, clearly benefited from advance votes. His advance ballot count alone exceeded the threshold required for PR seat allocation. Despite elections being held in only about 20 percent of Rakhine and Chin territory—most of which remains under resistance control—the results mean the regime is set to form “elected” state governments and assemblies through its proxy party and military appointees, who hold 25 percent of seats in the national and sub-national legislatures.

  "text": "Испанский теннисист Карлос Алькарас завершил сотрудничество с тренером Хуаном Карлосом Ферреро. Среди возможных наставников называли Роджера Федерера, который, несмотря на завершение карьеры, остаётся одной из самых влиятельных фигур в мире тенниса. Об этом сообщает TennisHead , пишет КТРК . Содержание Федерер рассказал о планах на ближайшее будущее Алькарас и его путь после Ферреро Достижения Роджера Федерера После завершения профессиональной карьеры Федерер сосредоточился на семье и общественных проектах, однако его имя продолжает связывать с крупными инициативами в теннисном мире. Вопрос о тренерстве Алькараса стал одним из самых обсуждаемых после разрыва испанца с Ферреро. Федерер рассказал о планах на ближайшее будущее Роджер прибыл в Австралию для участия в выставочных матчах, которые традиционно проходят перед началом Australian Open. В эфире TNT Sports его спросили, рассматривает ли он возможность тренировать Алькараса в будущем. По словам Федерера, сейчас он не планирует возвращаться в тур в качестве тренера, предпочитая посвятить время семье и детям. Он отметил, что уважает путь Алькараса и видит в нём сильного спортсмена, способного к самоподготовке. Тем не менее, швейцарец не исключил, что в будущем может попробовать себя в роли наставника, если появится подходящий момент. Алькарас и его путь после Ферреро Разрыв с Ферреро стал неожиданностью для многих болельщиков. Этот тандем принёс Карлосу победы на турнирах Большого шлема и статус первой ракетки мира. Однако молодой теннисист решил развиваться дальше, меняя подход к тренировкам. По данным TennisHead, Алькарас хочет сосредоточиться на улучшении психологической устойчивости и работе с новым аналитическим штабом. Федерер, наблюдая за карьерой испанца, отметил, что подобные решения в юном возрасте могут помочь сохранить мотивацию и избежать профессионального выгорания.

  "text": "Как сообщает Kreschatic , 17 января в Кыргызстане отмечают день ангела Георгия — дату, связанную с древними христианскими традициями и глубоким символизмом. Имя Георгий на протяжении веков считалось знаком силы, верности и благородства, пишет КТРК . Содержание История имени и значение для кыргызской традиции Характер и судьба людей с именем Георгий Народные поверья и как отмечают день ангела Стихи и поздравления с Днем ангела Георгия Имя имеет греческое происхождение и переводится как «земледелец» или «работающий на земле». В киргизской культуре этот образ перекликается с почтением к труду, земле и стойкости духа. Святой Георгий почитается как заступник воинов и хранитель честного труда. История имени и значение для кыргызской традиции Имя Георгий появилось на территории Центральной Азии вместе с распространением христианства. В старинных записях оно встречается в форме Юргий или Йорик, и всегда ассоциировалось с мужеством и миротворчеством. В народных представлениях Кыргызстана Георгий символизирует защиту, правду и готовность помогать ближнему. Люди, носящие это имя, обычно добросердечны и устойчивы к трудностям, их считают опорой семьи и друзей. Характер и судьба людей с именем Георгий Георгии — решительные и доброжелательные личности. Они ценят справедливость и искренность, не любят пустых обещаний и всегда стремятся к гармонии. В жизни таких людей выделяются три черты: стремление к внутреннему равновесию и мудрости; умение вдохновлять других; природное чувство долга и ответственности. Народные поверья и как отмечают день ангела В кыргызской традиции день ангела Георгия сопровождается тихими домашними встречами, молитвой и благодарением за прожитый год. Считается, что в этот день важно проявить доброту, примириться с теми, с кем были разногласия, и сделать доброе дело. Согласно народным поверьям: нельзя ссориться или обижать других — это принесёт неудачу; стоит освятить воду и умыться ею для очищения души; полезно загадать желание, связанное с благими делами — оно обязательно сбудется. Стихи и поздравления с Днем ангела Георгия Пусть ангел крылом укроет от бед, Пусть счастье живёт в душе много лет, Пусть свет в твоём сердце горит без конца, И вера не гаснет, как пламя свеча. Георгий, ты сильный, отважный, живой, Твой путь освещён самой верой святой, Пусть радость придёт в твой дом навсегда, И будет удача с тобой как звезда. В день ангела радость струится в дом, Пусть счастье окутывает теплом, Пускай твой защитник, святой и верный, Хранит тебя днём и ночью безмерно. Пусть день Георгия дарит покой, Пусть рядом идут удача с судьбой, Пусть каждый рассвет встречает тебя С надеждой, любовью и светом добра. Поздравления для именинников: Пусть ангел-хранитель оберегает твои шаги, а сердце наполняется светом и добротой. Пусть святой Георгий ведёт тебя по дороге честности, силы и внутреннего мира. Пусть день ангела принесёт гармонию в душу и напомнит, что добро всегда сильнее тьмы. Пусть радость и вера всегда будут твоими верными спутниками.

  "text": "Как сообщает The Stomping Ground со ссылкой на британского аналитика Гарета Дэвиса, украинский чемпион Александр Усик станет слишком сложным соперником для американца Деонтея Вайлдера. Эксперт уверен, что бой завершится до шестого раунда, пишет КТРК . Содержание Оценка Гарета Дэвиса Возможные соперники Усика после боя Карьера Деонтея Вайлдера Поединок планируется на конец весны и состоится в США. На кону будет стоять чемпионский пояс WBC, а для Усика этот бой может стать важным этапом карьеры после побед над Джошуа, Фьюри и Дюбуа. Оценка Гарета Дэвиса По словам Дэвиса, Усик находится в оптимальной форме, а его техника и выносливость станут решающими факторами в поединке с Вайлдером. Аналитик отметил, что американец не сможет выдержать высокий темп боя. Усик будет для него слишком сложным и остановит его за пять или шесть раундов. Эксперт подчеркнул, что победа укрепит статус украинца как одного из лучших боксёров современности и окончательно закрепит его в истории мирового спорта. Возможные соперники Усика после боя После встречи с Вайлдером украинец может выйти против британца Фабио Уордли или молодого Мозеса Итаумы. Эти поединки рассматриваются как продолжение чемпионской эры Усика. Если Усик победит Вайлдера, а затем встретится с Уордли или Итаумой, он окончательно утвердит своё место в истории бокса. Эксперты считают, что украинец способен завершить карьеру на пике, проведя серию решающих боёв против сильнейших соперников дивизиона. Карьера Деонтея Вайлдера Начал профессиональную карьеру после Олимпиады-2008, где завоевал бронзу. Провёл 49 боёв, одержал 44 победы, большинство — нокаутом. Владел титулом чемпиона мира WBC в течение пяти лет. Последний бой провёл летом 2025 года, победив Тайрелла Херндона.

  "title": "День ангела Елены 15 января: значение имени, черты характера и традиции праздника в Кыргызстане",
  "text": "Имя Елена в культуре Кыргызстана символизирует внутренний свет, мир и женственность. Этот день посвящён добрым и сильным женщинам, несущим гармонию в дом и вдохновение в сердца окружающих. Как сообщает Kreschatic , традиция чтить имя Елены имеет глубокие корни и отражает уважение к духовной чистоте и мудрости, пишет КТРК . Содержание Значение имени и его символика Характер и особенности Поздравления и стихи для Елены Традиции празднования в Кыргызстане Имя Елена означает «светлая», «сияющая». Оно связано с образом солнца, тепла и спокойствия. В Кыргызстане этот день отмечают как возможность пожелать женщинам с этим именем душевного равновесия, здоровья и семейного благополучия. Значение имени и его символика С древнегреческого «Елена» переводится как «солнечный луч». В местных традициях это имя ассоциируется с чистотой помыслов, миролюбием и способностью вдохновлять других. Женщины с этим именем часто становятся центром семьи, поддержкой и источником уюта. Имя несёт сильную энергетику, поэтому считается, что Елены обладают мягкой силой — они не подчиняют, а направляют. В кыргызской культуре это воспринимается как качество истинной хранительницы домашнего очага и покоя. Характер и особенности Елены спокойны, рассудительны и доброжелательны. Они редко вступают в конфликты, предпочитая мирное решение вопросов. Их внутренняя сила проявляется через заботу и умение выслушать. Женщины с этим именем обладают развитым чувством справедливости и умеют вдохновлять окружающих. Они чувствительны к настроению близких и часто становятся «душой компании». Согласно народным верованиям, в день ангела полезно: провести время с родными, избегая ссор; вспомнить добрые дела и поблагодарить жизнь за радость; зажечь свечу как символ внутреннего света; помолиться или просто поблагодарить за любовь и мир. Поздравления и стихи для Елены Авторские строки, которые можно посвятить именинницам: Пусть светлый день тебя хранит, Пусть нежность в сердце тихо спит, Пусть жизнь сияет, как рассвет, В душе любви пусть будет свет. Тебе, Елена, добрый путь, Пусть счастье тихо к дому придёт, Пусть все мечты свои найдут, А радость в сердце расцветёт. Светло твое имя, как лето в горах, Пусть мир и любовь живут в твоих снах, Пусть каждый рассвет тебе дарит покой, Пусть счастье идёт по жизни с тобой. Елена, солнце в имени твоём, Пусть жизнь наполнит дом теплом, Пусть радость будет каждый день, И сердце светит без проблем. Поздравления для Елены можно выразить в коротких пожеланиях: Счастья и тепла, пусть твой дом сияет миром и добром. Пусть каждый день будет шагом к мечте и спокойствию души.

  "text": "di Sara Scarafia Dall’Auditorium di Roma il cantante, che quest’anno compie 60 anni, ha fatto il suo omaggio all’ultimo dei surrealisti, intervistato da Dario Olivero su Robinson 19 Gennaio 2026 Aggiornato alle 12:03 1 minuti di lettura Già domenica mattina sui suoi profili social aveva segnalato l’intervista che apre il nuovo Robinson in edicola da domenica 18 gennaio. Ma è stato poi sul palco dell’Auditorium di Roma , dove Repubblica ha festeggiato i suoi primi cinquant’anni con grandi ospiti e con le grandi firme, che Lorenzo Jovanotti ha fatto il suo omaggio ad Alejandro Jodorowsky , l’ultimo surrealista, «regista, musicista, compositore, sceneggiatore di fumetti, scrittore, poeta, fabbricante di burattini, attore, mimo, genio intuitivo, psicoterapeuta, anzi la definizione corretta è psicomago», scrive Dario Olivero che lo ha intervistato per Robinson. di Dario Olivero 19 Gennaio 2026 Una conversazione che a partire dai tarocchi, ha attraversato il buio nel quale viviamo fino ad arrivare alla luce della speranza. Concita De Gregorio che ha intervistato Jovanotti sul palco della sala Sinopoli dell’Auditorium, è partita proprio da Robinson : «Ho letto l’intervista - ha detto il cantante - e l’ho anche segnalata a un po’ di amici. Ho detto “comprate Robinson ”». De Gregorio ha ragionato con Jovanotti, che quest’anno compie 60 anni e sta per partire con un grande tour, sulla sorgente inesauribile di energia che lo attraversa a partire dalla grande fiducia che Jodorowsky dà all’umanità e alle giovani generazioni. « Jodorowsky ha 97 anni: è una questione di età fino a un certo punto. Quando hai un progetto nuovo da iniziare sei sempre un ragazzino: è l’inizio che ti fa sentire così. Io credo che la chiave sia l’energia. Bisogna cercare gli spazi dove la vita può fiorire. Il mio comandamento è non lamentarmi e cercare di fare quello che mi è congeniale. Cosa posso fare di fronte alle tragedie del mondo? Quello che so fare: la musica. I miei concerti sono delle feste e le feste sono importanti nella vita: non risolvono i conflitti mondiali ma ti caricano, ti permettono di sentirti vivo, di sentire che c’è una vita che ti scorre dentro. La musica serve a questo, l’arte serve a questo. Ti fa sentire vivo. Il motore è l’amore: l’amore per quello che uno fa». di Silvia Fumarola 18 Gennaio 2026 Jovanotti ha voluto chiudere il suo intervento sul palco dell’Auditorium con De Gregorio tornando a Jodorowsky: «È un maestro. Stamattina, vedi i giornali a cosa servono, dopo aver letto l’intervista sono andato a prendere i miei libri di Jodorowsky. Ne ho aperto uno e c’era un raccontino, molto bello, che vi lascio come viatico. Ci sono una mamma e un nonno. Torna un ragazzino che ha giocato fuori: è tutto sporco. La mamma gli dice, vatti a lavare le mani, sei brutto tutto sporco. Lui rimane male e non obbedisce. Allora il nonno gli dice, vatti a lavare le mani, sei bello con le mani pulite.

These initiatives have established an important institutional foundation. The next stage is to ensure that these frameworks are translated into tangible economic activity, effective risk management, and strengthened regional leadership.   Hong Kong is well positioned to play a leading role in this transition, provided that climate and sustainability policies are closely integrated with economic strategy, fiscal planning, and regional engagement. With strong foundations, proven capabilities, and international credibility, Hong Kong can adopt a confident and outward-looking approach to climate and infrastructure leadership that unlocks new economic opportunities, strengthens regional relevance, and reinforces long-term fiscal resilience.   The 2026–27 Budget represents an important opportunity to move from frameworks to delivery, and from ambition to execution, positioning Hong Kong as a leading regional platform for sustainable development, finance, and infrastructure. Civic Exchange is pleased to submit our recommendations to the public consultation for the 2026–27 Budget of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Key highlights include:   Cross-cutting Governance Recommendation Establish a Financial Secretary–Led Steering Mechanism to Coordinate Delivery Strategic recommendations Position Hong Kong for Large Regional Impact Beyond Its Domestic Emissions Treat Hong Kong’s Urban and Infrastructure Experience as Exportable Capability Respond Proactively to Geopolitical and Regional Shifts Develop Hong Kong as a Regional Regulation, Talent, and Deployment Hub Position Hong Kong as a sustainable finance hub for the Asia Pacific region Establish a Hong Kong Green Exchange as a Trusted Regional Carbon Market Platform Support Long-Term Fiscal Stability Through Fair Motoring Taxation   Click ‘Read More’ to read the full submission.

Consolidating agreements like Qube’s across states is how we stop the race to the bottom and protect safe, sustainable jobs.” TWU VIC/TAS Director of Organising Sam lynch said workers wages are falling behind. “Qube, who have recorded year-on-year profit increases, need to come back to the negotiation table and get serious.” TWU officials say fragmented agreements and cost-cutting only made Australia’s transport industry worse Picture: NewsWire / Flavio Brancaleone A Qube spokesman said it was “disappointing” the union were trying to mount a “phony scare campaign” instead of engaging in good faith negotiations. The company has alternative supply arrangements in place if the strike action proceeds to mitigate any impacts to customers, supply chains or consumers. The action is likely to involve five drivers in Western Australia and up to 12 drivers in Victoria. Qube logistics has put alternative arrangements in place to mitigate any strike action. Picture: Supplied “The truth is the TWU have rejected a wage offer that would have seen workers covered by agreements in Victoria and WA achieve a wage increase of more than 12 per cent over the next three years and then they walked away from the negotiating table,” a spokesman said. “We urge the union to urgently resume negotiations so that we can resolve this dispute in the best interests of workers.” Originally published as Beer supplies across Australia Day long weekend under threat as transport union warns of strike action",

  "title": "Inflation, interest rates: IMF warns Australia faces years of economic pain ahead | Daily Telegraph",
  "text": "Australia is forecast to face a prolonged period of above-average inflation and below-trend economic growth, as global tariffs weigh on the national economy. In its latest economic outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns Australia will not be immune to cost of living pain, as US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy flows through. “With pass-through from higher tariffs gradually materialising, US core inflation is projected to return to the country’s 2 per cent target during 2027,” the IMF report states. “Australia and Norway are also projected to see some drawn-out persistence in above-target inflation.” Australia faces a prolonged period of above average inflation. Picture: NewsWire / Nicholas Eagar Australia’s headline annual inflation rate dropped to 3.4 per cent from 3.8 per cent for the 12 months until November, according to official figures released in early January. Meanwhile, the all important trimmed mean inflation rate – which the Reserve Bank uses as it strips out volatile items including fuel – slipped to 3.2 per cent from 3.3 per cent for the year. And while inflation remains above the Reserve Bank target of 2 to 3 per cent, Australia’s economy will also continue to grow at below trend pace. According to Australia’s treasury department, inflation will return to the target range next financial year. Experts are divided about Australia’s current inflation rate and what it could mean for interest rates. Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank are both calling a rate rise after the RBA’s meeting on February 2-3, while Westpac and ANZ forecasts rates will be left on hold. According to the IMF, global inflation will continue to decline falling from 3.8 per cent in 2026 to 3.4 per cent in 2027. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the economic note highlights the current challenges for global economies. “The global economy is incredibly uncertain with persistently high inflation still a challenge for many countries around the world, and that’s reflected in this report,” he said “Volatility in the global economy was a key feature of my discussions with international counterparts last week and it will continue to weigh heavily on Australia in the months and years ahead.” Treasurer Jim Chalmers points Australia is not the only country facing inflation issues. Picture: NewsWire / Pool/ Martin Ollman The IMF also maintains its estimates Australia’s economic growth will pick up marginally from 1.9 per cent in 2025, to 2.1 per cent in 2026 and 2.2 per cent in 2027. Despite the below trend growth, Australia will actually grow faster than the combined advanced economies is projected to be 1.8 per cent in 2026 and 1.7 per cent in 2027. Advanced economies include the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. The US effective tariff rate underlying the projections is 18.5 per cent, compared with 18.7 per cent in the October forecast. The corresponding effective tariff rate for the rest of the world is unchanged at 3.5 per cent. Originally published as IMF warns of drawn-out cost of...",

  "text": "The doctor who first alerted police about mushroom murderer Erin Patterson is closing down his local practice to avoid “financial oblivion”. Dr Chris Webster treated two of Patterson’s guests, Ian and Heather Wilkinson, after the fateful meal, and he had arranged a transfer to a bigger hospital when the mother-of-two walked in. Patterson presented herself to emergency and said she had gastro. The doctor was quick to put puzzle pieces together, knowing three patients were being treated for suspected poisoning. He questioned Patterson and told her they needed to commence treatment on her for potential poisoning, prompting Patterson to leave the hospital. Patterson was later convicted of three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, and sentenced to a minimum 33-year non-parole period. She maintains her innocence and is appealing. Patterson and the mushroom trial caught the entire nations attention. Picture: Brooke, Grebert-Craig. During an interview with The Herald Sun last year, Dr Webster called Patterson a “disturbed sociopathic nut bag” and even a “crazy b***h,” among other statements. The series of comments resulted in punishment from Australia’s medical regulator. Dr Webster was forced to complete ethics training and was no longer allowed to supervise training GPs. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Dr Webster revealed why he chose to close down the rural clinic. He said it was both the lack of support from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and a refusal from colleagues to limit bulk billing that was putting his practice on the road to “financial oblivion”. Dr Webster became a key witness in the trial last year and says he remains committed to serving his community. Picture: NewsWire / Nicki Connolly The doctor said he would like to look at opening a “boutique” practice, for patients that approved his “compassion and skill,” he told the masthead “It will be a radically downsized clinic,” Dr Webster said. “I’ve got the community’s back and they’ve got mine. My books are always open,” he said. Leongatha Healthcare appear to have limited phone calls but are accepting appointments via HotDoc until early March. A spokesperson from the clinic also made contact with the Herald Sun. “There are a number of complex issues underlying the current situation, including longstanding concerns raised by staff and clinicians regarding workplace safety and governance,” the spokesperson said. Dr Webster and Leongatha Healthcare have been contacted for comment.

  "title": "Under-19 World Cup: Australia will look to Will Malajczuk to set the tone with another aggressive start",
  "text": "Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket. Followed categories will be added to My News. Australia has given Will Malajczuk a licence to thrill at the top of the order this Under-19 World Cup. The Aussies claimed a comfortable victory against Ireland on Friday, reaching the 236 target with eight wickets and 10 overs in hand. Malajczuk (22) was the only player in the top three to register a low score, with Steve Hogan (115) and Nitesh Samuel (77no) carrying the Aussies’ chase. But coach Tim Nielsen is backing the West Australian to make another aggressive start when the Aussies meet Japan on Tuesday night. “It’s certainly a bit of a planned attack on how we might attack our batting innings,” Nielsen said. Will Malajczuk may benefit from the ball travelling further in Namibia’s higher altitude when he attacks the new ball. Picture: Albert Perez/Getty Images “He played unbelievably well in the practice game against South Africa, got 80 odd off about 50 basically. “We feel as though we’re going to be playing against a fair bit of spin, so if we can get off to a bit of a start and add a bit of pressure on the opposition, we feel as though we might be able to change when they use their spinners. “If he does come off, it just gives the rest of the batting order that pillow, or buffer, that we’re going quickly at the start and they don’t have to be too panicky. “250 seems the going rate when teams play well, maybe a little bit more, so if we can get off to a bit of a start we feel we can take a chunk out of that total, especially if we’re chasing. “If he doesn’t come off, we’ve got the batting depth we feel to knuckle down and chase it through.” Tim Nielsen coached Australia in an ODI World Cup in 2011. Nielsen says a lot of Japanese players is familiar with the Aussies, having played club or school cricket Down Under before the tournament. He says the importance of a second win will be top of mind for his team, knowing how much it could set up their assault towards finals. “I think we need to make sure we’re on our game and not take (Japan) lightly … if we are to win tomorrow, it probably sees us qualify for the super six stage and then our game on Friday against Sri Lanka will almost be to see if we finish first or second,” he said.

Whether you’re planning a barbecue, tackling a home project, or squeezing in some shopping before the festivities, most major retailers and services will be open nationwide, although trading hours will vary depending on where you live. Major shopping centres follow state-specific trading rules: Canberra Centre and Canberra Outlet in the ACT will be open, while Rundle Mall in Adelaide will trade from 11am to 5pm. Picture: NewsWire / John Gass Supermarkets and major retailers Coles and Woolworths supermarkets will largely remain open across the country, with public holiday hours applying in most states. Stores in NSW, Victoria, the ACT and Tasmania are expected to trade close to normal hours, while Queensland outlets will generally open later and close earlier unless located in tourist precincts. South Australia will again have the strictest rules, with most metropolitan supermarkets closed and limited CBD and regional trading available. Western Australia and the Northern Territory will operate under government-approved public holiday hours. Big W and Kmart will also trade across most of the country, though several South Australian and regional stores will close for the day.

  "text": "Pauline Hanson has claimed the alleged assassination of right-wing political pundit Charlie Kirk was a “wake up call” to Australians, while positioning herself as the promulgator of the global right. Support for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party overtook the Coalition in the latest Newspoll survey for the first time, after surging seven points over the past two months to a whopping 22 per cent of the primary vote. Addressing the surge, Senator Hanson told reporters on Monday she had “been around long before Nigel Farage and long before (Donald) Trump”. “So, therefore, I’ve set the record, my record, what I want,” she said. “Don’t look at my speeches, what I’ve said in the past. I don’t back away from anything. I stand up for what I believe in. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson claimed the alleged assassination of Charlie Kirk was a ‘wake up call’ to Australians while addressing her party’s astonishing rise in the latest Newspoll. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman “And, that’s why now the people are seeing I have been someone who stood my ground over the years, that a lot of things that I’ve said and done over the years has now happened in our country.” Senator Hanson said she was “proud to acknowledged” One Nation’s polling and said both major parties were “lacking”. Australians were “fed up” and struggling with cost of living, she said. “But, I think it’s also seeing what happened with Bondi, and I think prior to that with Charlie Kirk, his assassination, has been a big wake up call for a lot of Australians. “Mass migration has also been huge, big issue for a lot of Australians who have been now for years calling out to this government (to) pull back on it. “Lack of housing, jobs, security, cost of living is a combination of a lot of things, and what they’re looking for is someone who really cares about their country, about them and about the future of the nation.” Senator Hanson has sought to blame “radical Islam” and immigration for the Bondi Beach terror attack. She was excluded from a Senate condolence motion for the victims after she was censured for a wearing a burqa in a widely panned stunt last year. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson, Senator Malcolm Roberts, Senator Sean Bell, Senator Tyron Whitten and Barnaby Joyce MP hold a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman Asked whether there would be more stunts, Senator Hanson said she was “standing my ground”. “If you really think that the support that we’re getting is because we’re in a burqa in the parliament – and it wasn’t a stunt, I was standing my ground that you didn’t want to introduce legislation to ban the burqa or full face coverings in public places – well then I will wear one, and that even upset them all, but I dare wear one,” she said.

  "text": "An 11-year-old surfer is “rattled” after a shark took multiple bites out of his surfboard in Sydney’s northern beaches – less than 24 hours after a horrifying shark attack in the city’s east. The boy was surfing at Dee Why on Monday morning when what is believed to be a four or five-metre bull shark lunged up at his board. The shark managed to bite at the boy’s board multiple times; however, he was unharmed. The Manly Observer reports that an older surfer helped the boy after he screamed for help. A photo of the boy’s surfboard shows a giant chunk taken out of the side. The incident comes just a day after a 12-year-old boy was left with critical injuries to both of his legs after a brutal shark attack in Sydney’s east. The 11-year-old boy’s board had a chunk taken out from the side. Picture: The Manly Observer Emergency services were called to Hermitage Foreshore Walk on Steele Point Road at Vaucluse about 4.20pm on Sunday following reports of a shark attack. His friends bravely worked together to pull him from the water, police said, exposing themselves to his “confronting” injuries in the process. He was transported by boat to Rose Bay, where he was taken to the Children’s Hospital in Randwick. Senior Constable John Morris told Sunrise the boy had “double tourniquets” applied to his legs by paramedics and police on the rock shelf.

He has since undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition with his parents by his side. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said the boy lost a significant amount of blood and was unconscious when paramedics arrived. “The boy had lost his pulse, there was a large blood loss, and the double tourniquet stemmed that flow of blood loss yesterday, and has contributed to saving his life,” he said. Friends praised for ‘brave’ act Constable Morris told reporters the boy was jumping off a six-metre rock with a group of teenage friends when the attack happened. Paramedics took the boy to hospital in a critical condition. Picture: ABC “We believe the combination of the brackish water, the freshwater, and the actions of the splashing may have made that perfect storm environment for that shark attack yesterday,” he said. He told Sunrise the water had become “muddy” after the bouts of rain over the weekend. “(The boys) were jumping into muddy water, and what we believe is a shark was in the vicinity, has bitten that boy’s legs,” he said. “One of his mates did jump in to pull him from the water’s edge to that rock platform as well, so he contributed to saving his life as well yesterday.” Originally published as 11yo surfer ‘rattled’...",

  "text": "La alta sociedad londinense vuelve a acaparar miradas. La cuarta temporada de “Bridgerton” fue presentada por todo lo alto en París, adelantando lo que Netflix estrenará el próximo 29 de enero: una historia inspirada en Cenicienta, pero con un giro inesperado y mucho más profundo. Cientos de fanáticos se reunieron la noche del miércoles en el Palacio Brongniart, en pleno corazón de la capital francesa, que se transformó en un escenario digno de la serie. El lugar fue decorado con los colores de “Bridgerton” y una pasarela ambientada como jardín inglés, por donde desfilaron las estrellas del elenco entre aplausos y cámaras. Estrenada en 2020, la producción —basada en las novelas de la escritora estadounidense Julia Quinn— se sitúa en la Inglaterra de principios del siglo XIX, donde los escándalos, romances y secretos de la élite londinense se mezclan con una narrativa moderna e inclusiva. La historia sigue a los ocho hermanos de la influyente familia Bridgerton, y cada temporada se enfoca en uno de ellos. googletag.cmd.push(); Te puede interesar: 'Euphoria' temporada 3 se estrena el 12 de abril con salto temporal En esta ocasión, el protagonismo recae en Benedict Bridgerton (interpretado por Luke Thompson), el segundo hijo de la familia, un artista bohemio y libertino que queda cautivado por la enigmática Sophie Baek. Lo que él ignora es que ella, al igual que en el clásico cuento de hadas, es en realidad una sirvienta. El elenco de “Bridgerton” desfiló en París durante la presentación oficial de la cuarta temporada de la exitosa serie de Netflix. Fotografía/ X @bridgerton “Diría que es un poco Cenicienta con un giro, y no exactamente Cenicienta. Es una historia de lucha de clases y de amor prohibido”, explicó a AFP la actriz Yerin Ha, de origen australocoreano, quien da vida a Sophie.

Las intrigas abordarán asuntos como las relaciones entre nobles y sirvientes, la discapacidad, la violencia de género e incluso la sexualidad femenina después de la menopausia, consolidando el sello social que ha distinguido a la serie. Un rostro conocido para los fans será el de Katie Leung, recordada por su papel de Cho Chang en la saga de Harry Potter, quien interpreta a la cruel ama —y madrastra— de Sophie. Netflix confirmó que “Bridgerton” se mantiene como uno de sus contenidos más exitosos desde su estreno, logrando posicionarse durante semanas en el top 10 global. Además, las temporadas cinco y seis ya están aseguradas, para tranquilidad de sus millones de seguidores alrededor del mundo. googletag.cmd.push(); CATEGORIA:  Entretenimiento | Escena",

  "title": "Oro y plata alcanzan máximos históricos por tensión entre Estados Unidos y Europa",
  "text": "El oro y la plata registraron un alza histórica en los mercados internacionales este lunes, impulsadas por el incremento de tensiones diplomáticas entre Estados Unidos y varios países de Europa. Durante la sesión matinal en las bolsas asiáticas, el oro alcanzó los 4,690.59 dólares por onza y la plata llegó a los 94.12 dólares por onza, cifras récord atribuidas a un aumento en la demanda de activos refugio. Las palabras clave que dominan esta jornada son: mercados, aranceles y Groenlandia. El aumento en el valor de estos metales preciosos se produjo tras la declaración del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, quien reiteró su intención de que EE.UU. tome el control de Groenlandia, una región autónoma bajo la soberanía de Dinamarca. Trump anunció un paquete de aranceles del 10% sobre las importaciones de Dinamarca, Noruega, Suecia, Francia, Alemania, Reino Unido, Países Bajos y Finlandia, con entrada en vigor a partir del 1 de febrero. Según lo expresado, las tarifas aumentarían al 25% desde el 1 de junio si no se accede a las demandas estadounidenses. Impacto inmediato en los mercados globales Vista de un barco danés en agua de Nuuk, Groenlandia. / Foto EFE El anuncio provocó una reacción inmediata en los mercados financieros. Mientras el dólar se debilitaba, los futuros europeos y estadounidenses mostraban caídas. En Asia, las bolsas de Tokio, Hong Kong, Shanghái, Sídney, Singapur y Wellington abrieron a la baja. Por otro lado, Seúl y Taipéi mostraron ganancias moderadas en la misma jornada.

Esta preferencia se reflejó en la fuerte alza de ambos metales preciosos, utilizados históricamente como reserva de valor en tiempos de volatilidad. Postura estadounidense sobre Groenlandia intensifica la tensión La controversia se intensificó luego de que el presidente Trump declarara que “se hará” el control estadounidense sobre Groenlandia, aludiendo a razones de seguridad nacional ante la creciente influencia de Rusia y China en el Ártico. A través de su cuenta en Truth Social, el mandatario aseguró que la OTAN ha advertido durante dos décadas a Dinamarca sobre la “amenaza rusa” en la isla, y criticó la falta de acción de ese país. Trump indicó que todos los países europeos mencionados han enviado tropas a Groenlandia y que los aranceles buscan presionar para obtener respaldo a los planes de anexión. La medida fue anunciada luego de que fracasaran negociaciones entre Estados Unidos, Dinamarca y las autoridades de Groenlandia el viernes anterior.",

  "title": "Nuevas leyes que entraron en vigencia a partir de enero en Estados Unidos - Noticias de El Salvador",
  "text": "Desde el 1 de enero de 2026, distintos estados de Estados Unidos comenzaron a aplicar un paquete de nuevas leyes que introducen cambios relevantes en áreas como medioambiente, tecnología, seguridad laboral, protección de menores y control de actividades comerciales. Las disposiciones afectan tanto a residentes como a empresas, turistas y profesionales que operan o viajan dentro del país, según información recopilada por Infobae a partir de fuentes oficiales estatales. Las normas, vigentes en estados como California, Indiana, Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas y Washington, responden a diagnósticos institucionales vinculados a la reducción de residuos, la seguridad en entornos laborales, el uso responsable de tecnologías emergentes y la protección de grupos vulnerables. De acuerdo con Infobae, los cambios suponen nuevas obligaciones para comercios, plataformas digitales, organizaciones benéficas y empleadores, además de sanciones para quienes incumplan la legislación. El conjunto de leyes refleja una tendencia creciente hacia una mayor regulación estatal, con el objetivo de elevar estándares ambientales, sociales y de transparencia en distintos sectores de la economía y la vida cotidiana. Te puede interesar: Advertencia para viajar a Guatemala por tensión en seguridad y operativos Prohibición total de bolsas plásticas en California Uno de los cambios más visibles es la prohibición absoluta de bolsas plásticas en California. La ley SB 1053, en vigor desde enero de 2026, elimina cualquier excepción relacionada con el grosor del material y obliga a supermercados, grandes almacenes y farmacias a entregar únicamente bolsas de papel reciclado, cobrando un monto mínimo por cada una. Según información de CalRecycle, la medida busca reducir la acumulación de residuos plásticos en vertederos y minimizar el impacto ambiental sobre la fauna. La agencia estatal señaló que la mayoría de los consumidores no reutilizaba las bolsas plásticas más gruesas, lo que motivó el endurecimiento de la normativa previa de 2014. La ley contempla sanciones para los comercios que no cumplan y campañas informativas para fomentar el uso de materiales reciclables. Nuevas reglas para juegos benéficos en Indiana En Indiana, la Gaming Commission estableció nuevas restricciones para los juegos benéficos como el bingo o eventos tipo casino con fines de caridad. Desde 2026, una misma instalación solo puede albergar este tipo de actividades hasta tres noches por semana, sin importar cuántas organizaciones participen. La decisión se tomó tras investigaciones oficiales que detectaron el uso de estos eventos como casinos encubiertos. La regulación aplica a clubes privados y salones de eventos, y tiene como finalidad preservar la integridad de las actividades benéficas y evitar el desvío de fondos. Límites al uso de redes sociales por menores en Virginia Virginia se convirtió en el primer estado en imponer un límite horario concreto al uso de redes sociales por menores. La nueva ley restringe a una hora diaria el acceso a plataformas digitales para menores de 16 años, salvo autorización expresa de padres o tutores.

  "text": "Mumbai: Meta has appointed Dina Powell McCormick as its new President and Vice Chairman, strengthening its leadership bench as the company accelerates investments in artificial intelligence, infrastructure, and long-term capital strategy. McCormick, who has been serving on Meta’s Board of Directors, will now join the company’s management team, playing a central role in shaping Meta’s corporate strategy and operational execution. Her appointment comes at a time when the tech giant is committing multi-billion-dollar capital to computing infrastructure and advanced AI systems, including its push toward personal superintelligence. In her new role, McCormick will work closely with Meta’s compute and infrastructure leadership to ensure these large-scale investments are aligned with the company’s long-term objectives while also delivering economic benefits in markets where Meta operates. She will also spearhead the development of new strategic capital partnerships and explore innovative funding models to expand Meta’s investment capacity over the coming years. Announcing the appointment, Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted McCormick’s global experience and financial leadership. He said her background in international finance and her relationships across governments and capital markets make her particularly well suited to help Meta navigate its next stage of growth. McCormick brings more than 25 years of experience across global finance, public policy, and economic development. She spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs, where she was a partner and a member of the firm’s Management Committee, and led its Global Sovereign Investment Banking business. During her tenure, she played a key role in launching and scaling major economic development platforms such as 10,000 Women, 10,000 Small Businesses, and One Million Black Women—initiatives designed to expand access to capital and drive long-term economic opportunity.

  "text": "Senior forward Jasmine Aikey was awarded the 2025 Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy on Friday – the most coveted individual honor in NCAA Division I soccer. Aikey is the sixth Cardinal to win the award, which has been presented annually to the National Player of the Year since 1967, while the selection is Stanford’s seventh overall. Including Aikey, a Cardinal player has claimed four of the last nine MAC Hermann Trophies, with Andi Sullivan earning the award in 2017, followed by Catarina Macario becoming a back-to-back winner in 2018 and 2019. Kelley O’Hara was the first Stanford player to win the MAC Hermann Trophy at the conclusion of the 2009 season. O’Hara was followed by Christen Press (2010) and Teresa Noyola (2011). “Winning the Hermann Trophy is an incredible accomplishment,” said the Knowles Family Director of Women’s Soccer Paul Ratcliffe . “I am so happy that Jasmine’s hard work and dedication paid off, as she is one of the most talented and competitive student-athletes I have ever coached. This past season, Jasmine helped lead our team to the College Cup Final while scoring some remarkable goals and proving to be a dominant player throughout the year. Jasmine is an outstanding scholar-athlete and has had an incredible career at Stanford in the classroom and on the field.” Aikey, who signed a professional contract with the NWSL’s Denver Summit FC earlier this week, is one of four finalists for the Honda Sport Award for Soccer and was named the Academic All-America® Team Member of the Year for Division I after leading Stanford to a national championship berth and a third consecutive College Cup appearance this season. With the selection on Friday, Aikey becomes just the second player in history to take home the Hermann Trophy and be named Academic All-America® Team Member of the Year – joining Portland’s Christine Sinclair who managed the feat in 2005. The 2025 TopDrawerSoccer Player of the Year and a United Soccer Coaches All-America first-team selection, Aikey led the Cardinal with 53 points and an ACC-best 21 goals, while tallying 11 assists and seven game-winners. She also led Division I in points, ranked second nationally in game-winning goals, and finished third in goals. The All-ACC first-team selection tallied at least one point in 20 of her 25 matches this year, and had at least one goal in 16 of the 25 contests to go along with five multi-goal games. Aikey’s 21 goals ranked tied for fourth in a single season in program history, while her 53 points ranked fifth. Her point total is also the most by an ACC player since North Carolina’s Casey Nogueira registered 58 in 2008. The ACC accounted for all three finalists on Friday, as Florida State junior forward Jordynn Dudley and University of Notre Dame sophomore forward Izzy Engle joined Aikey on the stage.

  "text": "La capture par les États-Unis du président Nicolás Maduro samedi 3 janvier porte dans l’immédiat un coup dur pour la Chine, prise en totale surprise et pour qui le Venezuela était un allié majeur en Amérique Latine. A plus long terme, l’aventure est risquée pour Washington que Pékin ne manquera pas de diaboliser pour dénoncer un nouvel impérialisme américain. Manifestement la Chine ne savait rien jusqu’au dernier moment de ce coup de force de l’administration Trump, une réalité qui, selon plusieurs analystes et experts, est d’autant plus gênante qu’elle semble trahir l’inefficacité des installations de détection électronique et des radars sophistiqués que Pékin avait installés au Venezuela d’où Pékin souhaitait espionner les États-Unis dont les côtes ne sont qu’à quelque 2 000 kilomètres. La deuxième évidence est que l’opération américaine porte un coup dur tant sur le plan économique que géopolitique à la Chine pour qui le Venezuela était devenu à la fois un partenaire clé où elle avait lourdement investi et un avant-poste majeur pour consolider son emprise croissante sur l’Amérique latine. Depuis des années, le Venezuela avait servi de vitrine pour les exportations militaires chinoises en Amérique latine. Sa défense aérienne s’appuyait sur des systèmes radar fabriqués par le China Electronics Technology Group (CETC), dont le radar de surveillance longue portée JYL-1 et le radar à ondes métriques JY-27 qualifié de « tueur furtif , » présentés comme capables de détecter des avions furtifs tels que les F-22 et F-35 américains à des centaines de kilomètres de distance et de guider des missiles S-300 de fabrication russe pour les intercepter et les détruire. Les unités marines du pays sont quant à elles équipées de véhicules blindés amphibies VN-16 et VN-18, de plateformes mécanisées et des systèmes de lancement multiple de roquettes SR-5, tous de fabrication chinoise. Ces matériels avaient permis au Venezuela de revendiquer l’une des forces amphibies les plus avancées de l’Amérique latine. Or il apparaît aujourd’hui que l’ensemble de la chaîne de commandement vénézuélienne s’est effondré très rapidement. Non seulement aucune alerte n’a semble-t-il été donnée à temps, mais nombre d’installations militaires vénézuéliennes ont été détruites sans aucune réaction tangible de l’armée. Ce fiasco militaire sera certainement dûment analysé par les partenaires de la Chine, devenue le quatrième vendeur d’armes dans le monde, ainsi que par ses rivaux, dont en première ligne les États-Unis et, bien sûr, Taïwan qui vit sous la menace constante d’une invasion comme l’ont démontré les dernières manœuvres chinoises fin décembre 2025. Un fiasco pour le matériel militaire chinois Dès le début des opérations américaines, aux premières heures du 3 janvier, les systèmes de détection chinois se sont révélés inefficaces. Selon des sources américaines, les installations radar ont été aveuglées lors de la première vague de guerre électronique, tandis que les forces terrestres vénézuéliennes, qui manquaient de couverture aérienne, ont été rapidement neutralisées avant même de pouvoir se déployer. L’opération a abouti à l’arrestation rapide et spectaculaire du dictateur vénézuélien Nicolás Maduro et de son épouse Cilia Flores. Le couple doit être...",

  "title": "200 hours of silence: Reporting from inside Iran - The Korea Times",
  "text": "A citizen sits helplessly on a Tehran street shrouded in tear gas, facing dozens of heavily armed riot police on motorcycles, Jan. 16, in this photo provided by local activists in Iran. Courtesy of AsiaN This dispatch was filed by Alireza Bahrami, an Iranian journalist, for AsiaN — the official news platform of the Asia Journalist Association (AJA). — ED. TEHRAN — After more than 200 hours of losing all access to the international internet, I am writing to the audience of AsiaN and the Asia Journalist Association (AJA) at the first opportunity of limited connectivity. Why? For three reasons. First, I have a moral obligation to AsiaN and AJA, and I must fulfill my duty as a journalist at all times. Second, as a journalist, I have a responsibility to convey the most accurate account of the situation I am in to people around the world — even if doing so is dangerous for me. Third, the last time I told the editor that I would send the article that night or the following morning, I lost access a few hours later and was unable to send any text. That situation lasted for 10 days. This could happen again. Therefore, I must use this opportunity immediately. Experience has shown that writing an analytical article requires careful consideration of all aspects. That is why I initially asked the editor for 48 hours and later requested a little longer. For this reason, what you are reading now is a more detailed analysis. I am certain that the situation in Iran may appear more heated in your minds than it is in reality. This is often the case. Those who follow events from afar through media coverage tend to see a slightly exaggerated version of reality. In this instance, when all communication was cut off and the media sometimes published their own assumptions, the magnification was even greater. That said, I personally experienced moments in my own city that I sincerely hope you will never have to face. I will now try to present an almost accurate and complete narrative. To do so, we must go back a little. When Mohammad Khatami, the founder of the “Dialogue of Civilizations,” became president in 1997, Iran’s international position was improving. However, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a right-wing politician, was elected president in 2005, conditions deteriorated. When Barack Obama signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran in 2015, the situation improved. However, when Republican Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, conditions worsened once again. In 2024, Masoud Pezeshkian became president of Iran in an effort to prevent war. Nevertheless, in 2025, Israel ultimately attacked Iran. Whenever Iran’s political relations in the international arena improved, the economic conditions and welfare of the Iranian people also improved. Conversely, whenever Iran’s global political situation became more confrontational, the economic conditions and welfare of the people declined. U.S. economic sanctions made governance more difficult for the Iranian state, but they placed the greatest burden on...",

  "title": "Samsung's Texas plant erges as buffer against possible US m ory tariffs",
  "text": "A Samsung Electronics semiconductor plant under construction in Taylor, Texas / AFP-Yonhap Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor plant in Taylor, Texas, is emerging as a potential buffer against the U.S. threat to impose a 100 percent tariff on memory chips, as the site offers room for future memory fabs aligned with Washington’s policy push. This scenario is gaining traction as U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters last week that memory semiconductor makers will have to either “pay a 100 percent tariff” or “build in America.” Although Lutnick did not single out any specific countries or companies, his comments were widely seen as a call for more U.S. investment from Korean memory makers Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, which dominate the global memory market. The two Korean chipmakers have responded to Washington’s frequently changing tariff push on chips by highlighting that they are building semiconductor plants in the U.S. While Washington has yet to spell out what would qualify as “build in America,” the fact that Lutnick made the remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony for Micron Technology’s new memory plant in New York suggests that building memory fabs in the U.S. could become a condition for exemptions from the proposed memory chip tariffs. Samsung Electronics and SK hynix are both building semiconductor plants in the U.S., but they currently do not include memory chip fabs. Samsung’s Taylor plant is currently designed as a foundry fab for system semiconductors, not memory chips. SK hynix is also building a chip plant in West Lafayette, Indiana, but it is an advanced packaging facility for memory chips rather than for front-end memory fabrication. Both companies say it is too early to gauge the impacts because no detailed requirements have been finalized. Meanwhile, concerns are growing that the market landscape could shift if Samsung and SK hynix face tariffs while Micron receives exemptions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaks during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. EPA-Yonhap To minimize the impact of potential tariffs, industry officials said Samsung could leverage the ample space at its Taylor plant site to build additional memory fabs. The site spans more than 5 square kilometers, with the core fab expected to occupy around 250,000 square meters. According to Samsung’s initial layout proposal to the city of Taylor, the site can accommodate up to 10 fabs, suggesting that it could theoretically redirect some of its planned investments, including memory fab projects in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, to the Taylor site. “In theory, building memory fabs in Taylor would provide greater predictability on tariffs for Samsung,” an industry official said. “While Washington has yet to spell out detailed guidelines, a 100 percent tariff could put it at a disadvantage compared with Micron.” However, it remains uncertain whether Samsung would be able to revise its investment plans easily. Washington’s tariff policy on chips remains unclear, and it is difficult to alter a long-term investment plan in response to sudden policy shifts. Officials at Samsung said they...",

  "title": "For Koreans, ‘good death’ means comfort, easing burden on family, study shows",
  "text": "getty imagesbank A growing number of Koreans now see a “good death” less as a family-centered moment and more as one free of pain and financial strain, a shift highlighted in a study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs (KIHASA). The report, published in the latest issue of the institute’s journal, Health and Social Welfare Review, analyzed responses from 1,021 adults aged 19 and older who took part in an online survey conducted between April 23 and May 7, 2024. Led by Oh Jong-min of Ewha Womans University’s School of Medicine, the research examined public attitudes toward death and preparations for one’s final years. Results showed that an overwhelming 97 percent of respondents considered minimizing physical pain essential to a good death, followed by easing families’ financial burden at 96.2 percent and sparing them from prolonged caregiving at 95.3 percent. These figures show that growing openness to hospice care here is driven less by acceptance of palliative medicine than by harsh financial realities. The data is also supported by a rise in so-called “caregiving tragedies” — a wave of murder-suicides fueled by the physical and financial exhaustion of families navigating a frayed social safety net. Despite widespread reflection on mortality, only 45.7 percent of adults said they had discussed future medical care or final wishes with family members. Nearly 79 percent reported thinking occasionally or often about their own death or dying process, including 85.2 percent of women and 79.7 percent of married respondents, compared to 71.7 percent of men and 74.4 percent of singles. While nearly all respondents saw the easing of survivors’ financial burdens as essential, fewer than a third — just 29.8 percent — said having family physically present at their deathbed was “very important,” underscoring a striking shift in cultural values. Reflecting this pragmatic turn, the study found rising openness to hospice and palliative care. More than 81 percent said they would consider using such services if terminally ill — particularly women (84.4 percent) and higher-income households (88.3 percent). Among those who were hesitant, about half cited cost concerns, while 43.5 percent said they associated hospices with the final stage of life. Notably, more than 91 percent of respondents said they would choose to discontinue life-prolonging medical procedures in end-of-life situations, with older adults expressing the strongest preference. Among those aged 65 and above, the rate rose to 94.7 percent, compared to 89 percent among those under 65. According to the National Agency for Management of Life-Sustaining Treatment, as of December last year, more than 3.2 million Koreans had registered advance directives refusing life-prolonging treatment — a record since the enactment of the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decision Act in 2018. Women accounted for roughly two-thirds of all registrants, and nearly one in four seniors aged 65 or older has signed such documentation. Researchers emphasized that concerns about pain and the desire to lessen economic or emotional burdens on family members are deeply tied to how Koreans define dignity in death. The research said the...",

  "text": "President Lee Jae Myung and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stand next to each other as they deliver a joint press statement after their summit at Cheong Wa Dae in central Seoul, Monday. Yonhap Korea and Italy pledged closer ties in advanced industries, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors and critical minerals, during Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Seoul for a summit with President Lee Jae Myung on Monday. The visit was the first by an Italian prime minister in 19 years, the first by a European leader since Lee took office last June and the first by a foreign leader since the presidential office returned to Cheong Wa Dae late last year. The two leaders had previously met at the G7 meeting in Canada in June and in New York during the U.N. General Assembly in September. In his opening remarks, Lee said cooperation was expanding in advanced sectors, including science and technology, aerospace and defense. Meloni noted that Korea has become one of the world’s largest per capita consumers of Italian goods. “If Italy’s traditional strengths as a scientific powerhouse are combined with the core DNA of the Republic of Korea as a technology leader, the two countries will be able to generate great synergy,” Lee said. “I hope the two countries will jointly respond to global challenges, including the climate crisis, and broaden the foundation of cooperation as partners that share common values.” President Lee Jae Myung shakes hands with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a joint press conference held after their summit at Cheong Wa Dae in central Seoul, Monday. Yonhap In response, Meloni — whose official title is president of the Council of Ministers — said that although Korea and Italy are geographically distant, the two countries share many similarities. \"Both countries pursue creativity and innovation based on traditional values, and in that sense, we can say we share the same values,\" Meloni said. \"The two countries should further explore which areas hold the greatest potential for development.\" She cited critical mineral supply chains, semiconductors, transportation, infrastructure and investments as key fields for expanding cooperation. On critical minerals, she called for “urgent joint research and other strategic cooperation,” and said Italy was working to create an environment in which major Korean companies could invest in fields such as robotics and microelectronics. President Lee Jae Myung and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raise their glasses during an official luncheon held at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul, Monday. Yonhap At a joint press conference after the summit, the two leaders pledged to deepen their strategic dialogue as a main forum for coordinating on regional and global issues and agreed to prepare a new bilateral action plan for 2026-2030 to guide cooperation between Korea and Italy. They reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, agreed to work closely to promote regional stability and underscored their shared pledge to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to lasting peace there.

  "title": "Genuine mindfulness or unrealistic expectations? Online debate erupts",
  "text": "Image generated using artificial intelligence What began as small, well-intentioned gestures — an expectant mother preparing meals for her husband or a parent handing out small gifts to fellow passengers on a plane — came under scrutiny after going viral online. The controversy began when a full-term pregnant YouTuber uploaded a video of herself preparing meals in advance for her husband. The footage shows her portioning vegetables and meat dishes so he would have food ready while she was in the hospital. Criticism mounted as the video spread online. One commenter said, \"In a climate where pregnant women already struggle to receive adequate consideration, videos like this reinforce the notion that women are expected to take care of their husbands even late in pregnancy.\" Another argued that the YouTuber should have more carefully considered the weight of her online influence. Others echoed the criticism. One user wrote, “When a creator with such influence chooses to widely share content like this, the implications go beyond an individual’s pastime,” adding that “it can become a benchmark that pressures women into certain roles.” Another commenter noted, “It’s easy to overlook the fact that content uploaded by major influencers functions as a social message.” As the controversy intensified, the YouTuber made all her videos private. A social media user criticizes a parent for handing out goody bags on an airplane. Captured from Threads A similar debate emerged from a recent story about a woman who handed out goody bags to fellow passengers on an airplane. A user on the social media platform Threads wrote that while such gestures may stem from individual thoughtfulness, their repeated circulation online risks turning them into unspoken expectations, making what was once optional feel obligatory. Another commenter voiced frustration, saying that parents who do not prepare goody bags are increasingly perceived as entitled. Not everyone agreed with that interpretation. Critics of the backlash said it was unreasonable to assume that personal acts of kindness would automatically harden into social norms. Regarding the meal prep controversy, some users said it was difficult to understand why third parties were quick to assign broader meaning to what was, ultimately, an individual decision. Others noted that the actions shown in the video were shaped by specific personal circumstances and that there is no basis for generalizing them or expecting others to follow the same approach. Online parenting communities and portal forums have also seen a steady stream of posts from parents sharing their own experiences of preparing meals in advance in anticipation of life after childbirth. One commenter pushed back against the criticism by pointing to differences in conditions abroad. “There are no postpartum care centers overseas, and food delivery options are often limited,” the user wrote. “If she meal-prepped, it’s something they could eat together, and she likely did it because she felt physically up to it. I don’t understand why outsiders rush to criticize when every household’s situation is different.” Noting that the YouTuber lives overseas, the commenter added that meal...",

  "text": "Job seekers visit a job fair in Seoul on Dec. 2, 2025. Yonhap Longer job searches and rising housing costs are intensifying economic pressure on young Koreans amid the country's structural challenges and sluggish growth, a central bank report said Monday. According to a report on youth economic conditions released by the Bank of Korea (BOK), many young job seekers are experiencing prolonged job searches early in their careers as companies increasingly favor experienced workers and expand rolling recruitment, rather than the traditional large, scheduled recruiting, amid sluggish economic growth. Those who remain unemployed for one year have a 66.1 percent chance of securing a regular job five years later, but the probability drops to 56.2 percent if unemployment lasts three years. Each additional year without a job was estimated to reduce current real wages by 6.7 percent due to a lasting \"scarring effect,\" the report said. The situation mirrors Japan's so-called employment ice age generation or lost generation, which entered the labor market during the country's prolonged economic stagnation in the 1990s and early 2000s, the BOK noted. Rising housing costs are adding to the burden. Young adults, who typically live in rental housing for school or work, are facing markedly higher monthly rents amid a shortage of small, non-apartment units, leading to a deterioration in housing conditions. The share of young people living in sub-standard housing rose to 11.5 percent in 2023 from 5.6 percent in 2010, according to the report. A 1 percent increase in housing costs was estimated to reduce total assets by 0.04 percent, while the share of youth debt in overall household debt surged to 49.6 percent in 2024 from 23.5 percent in 2012, it showed. \"The employment and housing challenges facing young people are structural issues that constrain the country's long-term growth,\" BOK official Lee Jae-ho said. \"Labor market reforms are needed to reduce job polarization, while the expansion of the supply of small homes is required to ease housing imbalances.\"",

  "text": "A poster for \"The First Slam Dunk” / Courtesy of Korean Film Council The Korean film industry has turned to the proven savior of Japanese animation since the start of the year to offset the prolonged slump of domestic productions. The box office in 2025 remained largely stagnant. Among domestic movies, the webtoon-based film “My Daughter Is a Zombie” managed to surpass the 5-million-viewer mark, and only three Korean titles managed to squeeze into the top 10 annual box office rankings. To combat declining ticket sales and a lack of blockbuster movies, movie distributors have launched aggressive re-release strategies. By bringing back beloved Japanese classics and modern hits that have strong fandoms, movie theaters aim to ensure a steady influx of niche but loyal audiences. “Recently, the theater-going experience has shifted toward fandom consumption,” an official in the film marketing industry here said on condition of anonymity. \"With animated features like ‘ Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — The Movie: The Infinity Castle ’ and ‘ Zootopia 2 ’ dominating the box office in 2025, theatres are prioritizing content that can guarantee physical attendance through old animated features with a large fan base.” Leading the trend is the legendary \"Evangelion\" series, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. To mark the anniversary, CJ CGV is screening the four-part “Rebuild of Evangelion” movie series in sequence. Since the original TV series was released from 1995 to 1996, the animation has gained massive global popularity by blending intense battles with deep psychological themes regarding the human condition. \"Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone\" (2007), the first part of the movie series, was released on Dec. 12, 2025, and the second installment \"Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance\" (2009) hit screens on Jan. 2. The relay will continue with \"Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo\" (2012), scheduled to be released on Friday, with the final installment \"Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time\" set for release next month. A poster for “Castle in the Sky” / Courtesy of Korean Film Council \"The First Slam Dunk,\" the 2023 phenomenon that sparked a retro basketball craze in Korea, is also back to mark its third anniversary. Having attracted over 4.9 million viewers during its initial run, the movie became the third-highest for a Japanese animated feature in Korea. The film was rereleased here last week. Based on the original comic series by Takehiko Inoue that began its serialization in 1990, the high school basketball comic has enjoyed immense popularity not only in Japan but also across Korea for decades. This time, the focus is on premium experiences. The film is being screened in specialized formats, including CGV’s IMAX, Megabox’s Dolby Cinema and Lotte Cinema’s Gwang-eum theaters, a sound-focused theater, so that they can deliver vivid experience of a basketball court to audiences. The lineup isn't just about nostalgia for the 90s. Studio Ghibli’s \"Castle in the Sky,\" the 1986 masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki, will return to the big screen on Wednesday to celebrate its 40th anniversary....",

  "title": "From Ram Janmabhoomi to Ram Setu: RSS legal arm Adhivakta Parishad is everywhere, but nowhere",
  "text": "In his inaugural speech, Thengadi spoke about what he described as the “cancer of minorityism”, questioned the absence of a uniform civil code, and asked why Article 370 was being recognised as a permanent feature of the Constitution. Thengadi’s vision wasn’t about simple reforms but a complete overhaul—of the law, the legal system, the Constitution, as well as the psychology of those involved in the process. And he saw the Adhivakta Parishad at the centre of this change. “The Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad…is competent and determined to become the nucleus of the Constituent Assembly of the resurgent Bharat,” Thengadi said. Its initial patrons included legal luminaries such as former Supreme Court judges justices H.R. Khanna and E.S. Venkataramiah, as well as senior advocate Ram Jethmalani. Over the past three decades, the organisation has grown extensively and claims an average of 200 lawyers in every district court, putting its total membership in lakhs. Lawyers associated with the Parishad claim credit for shaping several landmark judgments — from the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute and Ram Setu case to litigation related to Muslim reservations in states. ‘The Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad…is competent & determined to become nucleus of the Constituent Assembly of the resurgent Bharat,’ RSS ideologue Dattopant Thengadi told lawyers in his 1992 speech.They also speak of their involvement in a wide spectrum of cases on issues ranging from women’s rights and digital literacy to preserving the country’s history and culture, love jihad, and religious conversion. However, none of the cases is filed in the Parishad’s name. In that sense, the organisation is everywhere, but nowhere. It doesn’t have formal registrations or a register of its members. Its office-bearers say the lawyers’ association is not affiliated with any political party, and call it an “apolitical organisation”. At the same time, they also describe the Adhivakta Parishad as being a part of a “larger ideological community”, with the RSS as the mentor of that ideology, and say it shares a “family” relationship with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Some of its members, such as Justice Adarsh Goel, have also made it to the bench, while others, like Bhupender Yadav, have made a name for themselves in politics. The Parishad’s power was on full display late December 2025, at its 17th National Conference in Balotra in Rajasthan. Over 2,000 lawyers, a majority of them government advocates, attended the conference. Over two days, they heard sitting Supreme Court and high court judges, senior advocates, and even Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, and discussed what they called forces working to weaken the objective of “social harmony” in the country, and strategised about ways to preserve the cultural fabric of India. They were gearing up for courtroom battles during the day, and dancing with professional Bhangra performers in the evenings. Dattopant Thengadi’s vision wasn’t about simple reforms but a complete overhaul —of the law, the legal system, the Constitution. | dbthengadi.in/gallery At the conference, North Zone Organisation Secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad, Shreehari Borikar, reminded...",

  "text": "As the February 2026 elections draw near, history is in the making—a shift that now dominates conversations across court premises. Election posters in one of the narrow Tis Hazari lanes | Ruchi Bhattar | ThePrint >Advocate Anju Dixit steps out of her grey Thar early afternoon, back from Rohini court after a campaigning session there. Walking across the Tis Hazari court’s civil wing, colleagues who recognise her stop her frequently, wanting to know more about the upcoming elections. Dixit has been in practice for nearly three decades. Yet, this is the first time she is contesting the Bar Council elections. “This reservation is a first, so we built up some courage… God has given us a lot of calibre. Women should step forward now,” she says, her face beaming with a first-timer’s delight. Governing one of the country’s largest and most diverse legal communities, and historically almost entirely male in its leadership, the Bar Council of Delhi has been a paradox. Elections to the council are held once every five years, with enrolled advocates voting to elect 25 members. They go on to shape policy and administration within the profession. Up until now, the Bar Council of Delhi had elected only two women. Now, in 2026, that record is finally being put to the test. Five of its 25 elected seats are reserved for women this time, with two more to be filled by co-option—a structural opening created by judicial intervention, but intended to be carried forward by women willing to contest. With over 1.65 lakh registered advocates as of January 2026, the Delhi Bar Council is the largest in the country. The Supreme Court intervened after women approached the court, highlighting the structural exclusion of women from leadership positions in the Bar across the country. The court noted that despite a growing number of women entering the legal profession, institutional power within bar councils remained overwhelmingly male-dominated. Women candidates on election posters at Tis Hazari | Ruchi Bhattar | ThePrint Unlike loud political contests, Bar Council elections are fought in small, personal exchanges—a word outside a courtroom, a handshake near the canteen, a message on WhatsApp. Many women candidates say balancing court work with campaigning has meant longer days and fewer breaks, but also a heightened sense of visibility. For Advocate Vani Singhal, who practises civil and commercial law, the change is overdue. “Earlier, the Bar Council was almost entirely male,” she says, handing out her election postcard with folded hands. “There was no female lens to address female problems.” Issues like the lack of washrooms, the absence of complaint mechanisms, and everyday indignities were rarely treated as institutional concerns, she says. “With women there, priorities will change.” Advocate Anushkaa Arora juggles client meetings with short campaign stops between court hours. Enrolled in 2018, she says the reservation has made leadership feel within reach for younger advocates. “This has given women the confidence to come forward,” Arora says as she calls up a fellow lawyer for a chamber campaign....",

  "title": "How Ukraine war brought a $2.2 bn-dollar dispute between Russian company & Italian firm to Bombay HC",
  "text": "The contracts were for the construction of a fertiliser plant in Kingisepp in Russia’s Leningrad Region. However, in 2022, the EU imposed intensified sanctions on Russia citing its invasion of Ukraine, leading to Tecnimont terminating one of the contracts. EuroChem then terminated the remaining two contracts, alleging Tecnimont had failed to properly perform its services. Since then, the MAIRE group has maintained that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the English court are the sole authorities to decide on the dispute according to the contracts. It initiated arbitration under the ICC Rules in London in 2022. Late last year, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal allowed Tecnimont to seize EuroChem’s assets in every country, totalling Euro 1.1 billion, according to apress releaseby the MAIRE group. Meanwhile, EuroChem approached the Moscow Commercial Court last year, seeking recovery of unutilised advance payments and damages, among other things. In orders passed in November and December last year, the Moscow court directed Tecnimont and MT Russia to pay EuroChem about $2.19 billion, amounting to Rs 19,598 crore. EuroChem has now approached the Bombay High Court, seeking an Indian decree for Rs 19,598 crore, relying on the Russian judgment as “conclusive evidence of this debt”. In response, the MAIRE group said in a press statement issued Wednesday that EuroChem was trying to seek refuge under the “favorable and friendly Russian courts”, but the Russian judgment cannot be enforced outside Russia. Also Read: Firm wouldn’t exist without you—HC snub to Marion Biotech directors in Uzbekistan cough syrup deaths According to the suit filed by EuroChem in the Bombay High Court, MAIRE’s assets worth $2.2 billion are at stake. The suit, seen by ThePrint, lists these assets, which include 100 percent shares in its subsidiary Tecnimont Pvt Ltd (TCMPL) registered in India, a GST balance of Rs 119 crore with government authorities, and a balance of Rs 4 crore with government authorities. It also includes payments under lump sum EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contracts for the construction of new acrylic acid and butyl acrylate units in Gujarat, a paraxylene plant and related infrastructure in Odisha, and a new polypropylene plant and related facilities in Bihar. All these projects were awarded by IOCL to Tecnimont through TCMPL. The suit also lists the balance and deposits maintained by the Italian company with Kotak Mahindra Bank, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered Bank. The Italian company has alleged that the EuroChem group of companies is owned by Andrey Melnichenko, who is sanctioned under EU Regulations. In 2022, the European Union imposed sanctions on Melnichenko as part of its restrictive measures to target actions undermining or threatening Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. The EU said Melnichenko was part of the most influential circle of Russian businesspeople with close connections to the Russian government. It alsonotedthat Melnichenko was involved in economic sectors providing a substantial revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.

  "text": "In its 14 January order, the court also remarked that substandard drugs are a major issue in the health system, and that the “enforcement of public health laws cannot be thwarted by technical objections”. The company and its directors had argued they could not be held liable simply because they held the designation of directors, but the court rejected this argument saying it led “nowhere”. The court said the directors were “fully responsible” as the company would not exist without them. According to the directors, there was no allegation of direct liability, involvement, connivance or neglect against them, which they argued, are essential elements required to impute criminal liability against company officials. Justice Singh said the directors are “closely associated” with the company’s day-to-day working and in their absence the company does not exist. To accept the directors’ argument, felt the judges, would be a narrow interpretation of the law, and would defeat the purpose and objective of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The drugs inspector had operated well within his rights under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, by collecting samples of the syrup and initiating prosecution based on the lab results, the court noted in its order, while rejecting the company’s concerns about the manner of carrying out the sample-collection. The report which was prepared after this analysis also laid the basis for prosecution of the company and its directors, the court pointed out.

The court noted that the magistrate had issued a summoning order, requiring the company’s directors to present themselves before the court. The court also said ethylene glycol was used in the syrup despite it being prohibited under prevailing quality standards for medicines in 2021. Appearing in the case, the Centre said, “Ethylene Glycol and Diethylene Glycol were completely prohibited for use in manufacturing of DOK 1 Max Syrup.” But, test reports showed that these were used in manufacturing the syrup, the Centre said. It said both of these chemicals are toxic and harmful for human health. They are used in lubricants, brake fluid and inks, and if swallowed, can result in coma, seizures or even renal failure, the Centre said. In its 21-page ruling, the court also said that Marion Biotech had failed to produce the supplier certificate, which would show the analysis of propylene glycol used in their products, as was required under the 1940 Act. The court also said the cough syrup company had purchased and used an industrial grade, non-pharmaceutical chemical like propylene glycol from a company called Maya Chemtech India, which did not hold any drug license . A drug license is a basic prerequisite to manufacturing a drug.

  "title": "‘No illegality’: SC rejects Justice Yashwant Varma’s plea, clears way for Lok Sabha inquiry panel",
  "text": "The key contention of Justice Varma was that the Lok Sabha Speaker had proceeded to form the committee without awaiting the Rajya Sabha chairman’s decision on the admission of a motion that was moved in the Upper House of Parliament. Justice Varma said since the Rajya Sabha Chairman, a position held by the Deputy Chairman then, had dismissed the motion there, the Lok Sabha Speaker was barred from constituting the panel. This was in view of Section 3(2) of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, which mandates a joint probe panel if the impeachment motion is moved in the two Houses on the same day. Since it was done in his case, Justice Varma argued that the Lok Sabha Speaker could not have unilaterally constituted the panel. Besides, he contended that the Rajya Sabha Chairman had dismissed the impeachment motion moved before him. In such a scenario, Justice Varma argued, the Lok Sabha Speaker could not have entertained the motion in the Lower House. At the outset, the bench dismissed Justice Varma’s interpretation of Section 3(2) of the 1968 Act. It said the joint committee, under the provision, is mandated only when notices of motion given in both Houses, on the same day, have been admitted. The provision, in its present form, was silent of a situation witnessed in the present case. In case, a law has gaps, then the Constitution and doctrine of silence must be read into the statute to fill this vacuum. “The Constitution is the supreme and overarching legal framework, to which all statutes must conform,” the bench said. If Justice Varma’s argument is accepted, then it would produce absurd results and disable the Lok Sabha Speaker from proceeding, the court added. To interpret” it “in the manner suggested…would require us to read into it a disabling consequence, namely, that the motion pending in the other House must also necessarily fail. Such an interpretation would amount to judicial legislation, a course we are neither empowered nor inclined to undertake,” the bench said. The proviso cannot be read in a way that it nullifies the provision, it added. “There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law.” Justice Varma’s interpretation would make the law open to abuse, the bench said. “It would permit a situation where, upon getting the wind of a notice of motion being given for removal of a judge with a real likelihood of the same being admitted by the Presiding Officer of one House, certain members of the other House not inclined to have the process of removal initiated against the judge may deliberately give a defective notice on the same day, solely with the intention of scuttling the proceedings,” it said. Justice Varma’s second ground of challenge was also dismissed as legally untenable. According to him, the motion was rejected by the Deputy Chairman who held the post following the resignation of RS...",

On the patient’s medical status, the Centre said that he was in an irreversible, permanent state. and showed no chance of improvement, rendering the continued treatment futile. Rana has been on long-term artificial nutrition and hydration since he fell from the fourth floor of his PG hostel in Punjab University, where he was pursuing an engineering course, back in 2013. The parents, earlier in 2024, requested the Delhi High Court to constitute a medical board to examine whether it would be possible to withdraw their son’s life-support system, but the high court declined. The Supreme Court, at the time, did not entertain their appeal either, but gave them the liberty to approach the court again later. After Thursday’s hearing, the two-judge bench of justices J.B. Pardiwala and K.V. Viswanathan reserved its verdict. Striking a note of caution, it said,“These are very delicate issues. We decide matters every day, but who are we to decide about someone’s life? We are mortals.” The Centre’s submissions in court reflected the legal and medical positions on passive euthanasia. In its submission, the Centre relied heavily on two Supreme Court rulings, including the 2018 Common Clause judgment, that prepared the ethical and constitutional foundation for passive euthanasia. The note also hinged on an opinion rendered by two medical boards—set up on the top court’s directions in December 2025. The 2018 Common Clause judgment placed a particular emphasis on compassion, dignity, and medical futility during considerations over patients in an irreversible permanent vegetative state. Through that order, the court permitted the drafting of living wills and laid down extensive, albeit cumbersome, guidelines to assist passive euthanasia. It created a strict framework for the assisted end-of-life process. Later in 2023, on an application by the Indian Society for Critical Care Medicine, the top court eased the steps for granting passive euthanasia to terminally ill patients. The Centre’s note to the court highlighted the legal position on passive euthanasia, permitting the withdrawal of medical intervention that no longer served any therapeutic purpose and merely prolonged the dying process. It also dealt with the long-drawn argument over medical ethics and the risk that passive euthanasia could pose to medical practitioners by distinguishing between an unlawful act causing someone’s death and the lawful withdrawal of an artificial, futile medical treatment. Drawing support from the judicial precedents, the Centre’s note submitted that the removal of artificial feeding mechanisms did not amount to causing death. Instead, it constituted cessation of an artificial medical intervention, where death was due to an underlying, irreversible condition of the patient. The support system did not have a life-sustaining function independent of the medical regime, the note...",

  "title": "ED-Jharkhand Police face-off: HC raps cops, stays probe in assault case against agency officers",
  "text": "“The S.S.P (Senior Superintendent of Police), Ranchi , is also directed to look into the security of the office of the Directorate of Enforcement, Ranchi. It is made clear that if any untoward incident occurred in the said (ED) office, the S.S.P, Ranch will be held liable for that,” Justice Dwivedi observed in the order.  He was hearing a plea by two ED officers seeking to quash an FIR lodged against them on a complaint by Santosh Kumar, a former cashier-cum-upper divisional clerk in Jharkhand’s Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, who is under probe for the alleged siphoning of Rs 3 crore. The HC also stayed the proceedings in the FIR registered against the two ED officers. “The High Courts are very slow in passing interim protection at the initial stage of the FIR, however, in the facts like present one brought before the High Court, the High Court cannot be a mute spectator, however, all these findings can be only given once the other sides are responded in the petition,” Justice Dwivedi said. The federal probe agency has a zonal office in Ranchi, which was “encircled” by heavy police deployment Thursday, way before the official working hours. A few hours later, a team of the Ranchi district police entered the office, claiming they were there to probe a case against ED officials booked in an assault case.  Kumar was arrested by the police in April 2024 in connection with the alleged siphoning of nearly Rs 3 crore, which also forms the basis of the ED’s money-laundering investigation. Representing the federal probe agency officials, Advocate Amit Kumar Das argued that the investigation and action by the Ranchi Police, prima facie, appeared to be a “pre-planned tactic” to “disrupt the investigation being made by the Directorate of Enforcement wherein high-profile persons of the state are involved and, as such, protection is needed by this Court.” He argued before the High Court that a substantial police presence arrived at the office premises of the ED around 6 am on Thursday and tried to treat the agency’s office as a crime scene.  The High Court asked the state government to file a counter-affidavit within a week and listed the matter for further hearing on 9 February. The complainant in the FIR against the ED officers also sought 10 days’ time to file a counter affidavit, which was granted by the court. BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Jharkhand Assembly  Babulal Marandi said the Enforcement Directorate office saw massive police deployment Thursday.  (Edited by Ajeet Tiwari) Also Read: ED vs Mamata: SC says dispute ‘serious’, seeks Bengal CM’s response on ‘interference’ in I-PAC raid   var ytflag = 0; var myListener = ; function lazyloadmyframes() { var ytv = for (var i = 0; i < ytv.length; i++) { ytv[i].src = ytv[i].getAttribute('data-src'); } }",

  "title": "From makeshift structures to modern courts—10 UP districts to get integrated judicial complexes",
  "text": "The first phase will be inaugurated Saturday in Chandauli where Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Supreme Court judge Vikram Nath will lay a common foundation stone for six districts: Chandauli, Hathras, Mahoba, Auraiya, Shamli and Amethi. The proposed integrated court building will facilitate a convenient and user-friendly work environment for lawyers, court staff as well as litigants, sources in the know told ThePrint. “These complexes have been planned in such a way that they will accommodate all types of courts such as criminal, civil, motor-accident, special courts, in a single building, offering all facilities and conveniences as a holistic solution in a green, sustainable and futuristic integrated court complex,” one of the sources said. The project is a collaborative exercise between the state’s Yogi Adityanath-led government and the Allahabad High Court. The estimated cost of the first phase, covering six districts, is over Rs 1,630 crore. Sources in the UP government told ThePrint that several of the districts were formulated by the Mayawati government and the one prior to hers. Despite having been in existence for over 25 years, none of the districts had any court complex. Courts were scattered all over, with one operating in one corner and the other somewhere else. Before the government took up the task of providing proper judicial infrastructure in these districts, it initiated the process of developing them first. For this, the state established police lines and then undertook construction of district jails. Given that judicial infrastructure is critical to a district, the state then planned creation of an integrated court complex at the instance of the HC. The court buildings have been designed to include a 250-seating capacity conference hall, a residential complex for judicial officers, recreation centre such as meeting room, mediation room, yoga room, gymnasium, dining with kitchen and suites. Advocate chambers, waiting rooms for litigants and parking area will be the other facilities at these new complexes that will be equipped with the latest technology to facilitate online hearings and use of Artificial Intelligence tools. To be built at the cost of Rs 286.39 crore, the Chandauli district court will have 37 courtrooms, while Hathras will have 44 that would entail an expenditure of about Rs 322.31 crore. In Mahoba, 37 courtrooms will be built at Rs 287.42 crore and in Shamli 23 that would cost Rs 240.22 crore. Auraiya will have 37 courtrooms at the cost of Rs 278.66 crore and Amethi will see a spending of around Rs 220.03 crore on 17 rooms. The sources said that the design of these complexes is such that they would be in a position to accommodate more judges and court staff in case the strength increases in future. “Considering that more citizens are resorting to litigation, it is possible that more judicial officers get appointed to these courts in future. The proposed plan has kept this possibility in mind and allows for space to adjust in case of new appointments,” the source mentioned earlier said. (Edited by Nida...",

  "title": "Higher education institutions must immediately report student suicides, unnatural deaths to police—SC",
  "text": "“Youth and young adulthood are increasingly recognised as vulnerable phases, with most mental health conditions emerging before the age of 24. The 2022 National Suicide Prevention Strategy also identifies the youth and students as priority groups while recommending multi-sectoral interventions. However, in such multi-sectoral interventions, it is found that academic campus-based efforts in India are fragmented and under-evaluated,” the bench said Thursday. Invoking its power to do absolute justice, the Supreme Court also issued guidelines. Firstly, the court said that the Sample Registration System data on suicides, especially those falling within the age group of 15-29 years, must be centrally maintained for better and more accurate estimates of suicides in HEIs. The mechanisms for obtaining and maintaining this data may be developed with the help of experts in the field of public health and demography. Secondly, the National Crime Records Bureau, in its annual report, must distinguish between school-going students and students of higher education in its categorisation of “student suicides”. Thirdly, all HEIs must report any incident of suicide or unnatural death of a student, regardless of the location of its occurrence (i.e. on campus, hostels, PG accommodations, or outside the institutional premises), to the police as soon as they come to know of the incident. “This should cover all students, irrespective of whether they are studying in the classroom, distance or online mode of learning,” the court emphasised. The bench also said that an annual report of student suicides or even unnatural deaths must also be submitted to the University Grants Commission and all other relevant regulatory bodies for professional courses like the Bar Council of India (BCI) in case of law schools or the National Medical Commission (NMC) for medical students. In case of central universities and Institutes of National Importance like NLUs or IIMs, the annual report must be submitted to the Department of Higher Education. Every residential institute must have access to qualified medical help round the clock, if not on campus, then within a 1 km radius to provide emergency support to students, the court also said, while adding that faculty shortages must also be catered to. “Faculty shortages which have been reported in several HEIs, both public and private, it must be ensured that all vacant faculty positions (both teaching and non-teaching) be filled within a period of four months, with priority given to posts reserved for candidates from marginalised and underrepresented communities including those posts reserved for PwDs,” the court said. For accountability, the court directed all HEIs to report on an annual basis to the central and relevant state governments, about how many reserved posts are vacant, how many are filled, reasons for non-filing and time taken so that periodic accountability is ensured. The backlog of any and all pending scholarship disbursements must be cleared within a period of four months by the relevant central and state government authorities, the court ordered.

  "title": "Yahoo yodel to Taj Hotels’ signature sonic sound, how the law protects unconventional trademarks",
  "text": "The legal team behind this development at Fidus Law Chambers told ThePrint that their application for the sound mark highlighted the sound’s uniqueness as a carefully crafted artistic creation with a defined structure and intent, as opposed to an ordinary audio. “It is a short harmonic chime, composed to evoke serenity, luxury and warmth-qualities that resonate deeply with the guests’ expectations in the hospitality sector,” Astha Negi, partner, Fidus Law Chambers, told ThePrint. The question many are asking is: Why would a hotel like the Taj trademark a sound? What is a sound trademark, and more importantly, what purpose does it serve? The answer is simple. In an increasingly experience-driven marketplace, aural branding plays a powerful role as it helps associate a sound with the brand, thereby increasing its brand value, advocate Shwetasree Majumder, managing partner at Fidus Law Chambers, who is behind this development, told ThePrint. The sound mark comes after the brand’s 2017 trademark protection for its unique dome-shaped building, the first such instance in India, which was spearheaded by lawyer Pravin Anand, managing partner of intellectual property law firm Anand & Anand. Globally, buildings like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sydney Opera House and the Empire State Building in New York have also received trademark protection. “I also secured trademark protection for the unique Zippo lighter shape, which is markedly different from other lighters owing to its breathable windscreen chimney design. Besides this, I secured trademark protection for the Louis Vuitton emblematic Epi leather surface pattern, which is characterised by a unique horizontal wave or ripple pattern embossed onto a leather surface,” Pravin Anand told ThePrint. He added that the red soles of Christian Louboutin and the Birkin bag shape, along with the crumpled, textured wrapper of the Ferrero Rocher chocolate, and the ICICI sound mark, were also his contributions. Also Read: A tyre by any other name can’t smell as rose-like — The story of India’s first olfactory trademark A musical or sound trademark is a sound that uniquely identifies a brand, much like a logo or a brand name. “When consumers hear the sound, they immediately associate it with a particular company or product,” Negi told ThePrint, while adding that it’s different from ordinary background music or incidental audio. The sound must function as a clear indicator of origin, Negi added. Under Indian law, sound trademarks are recognised under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which essentially allows for the protection of non-traditional or unconventional marks as long as they can be clearly represented and are capable of setting apart a business’s goods or services from another’s. However, it’s the Trade Marks Rules, 2017, which specifically acknowledge sound marks and set out the process for registering them, including the requirement to submit the sound in MP3 format along with a written and graphical description. A trademark is a symbol, design, word, shape, sound, smell or phrase used to identify a business’s goods or services. Once registered, a trademark owner can claim exclusive rights over its...",

  "title": "Tension Returns to European Stock Markets Following Trump's New Tariff Threat in His Offensive to Acquire Greenland",
  "text": "One year after the magnanimous Donald Trump took office as President of the US and ten months since he lifted the veil on tariffs and a new world order, nerves and uncertainty have resurfaced at the opening of markets this Monday. This weekend, the US President once again threatened with more tariffs against eight European countries if they do not back down in their support and sending of troops to Greenland. These countries are Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, which have sent soldiers as a symbolic gesture to send a message to the White House that Greenland is not alone.Currently, the Trump Administration announced tariffs of 10% starting from February 1 against products from these countries and they will increase to 25% starting in June if no agreement is reached. However, the European Union has also taken action, causing unease among investors who, on the other hand, are quite accustomed to the aggressive rhetoric of the US President. What is less common is that Brussels, tired of the constant attacks from the US and its lack of diplomacy, has threatened in return to invalidate the trade agreement reached last summer and activate the anti-coercion mechanism by which it would impose tariffs on US products worth 93 billion euros, which was approved in 2025 and was put on hold at the time due to the agreement reached with the US.With this scenario, European stock markets start the week with losses, and with no reference from Wall Street, which is closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day, although futures of major indices are trading lower. The EuroStoxx 50, the benchmark index where the largest European companies are listed, is losing around 1.3% and is risking the 5,950 points mark in the session. This is due to the impact that renewed trade tensions are having on the European automotive and luxury sectors. The Franco-Italian contact lens company EssilorLuxottica is the most affected in the index, with a 3.9% drop, given its deeply international nature. In fact, it has an alliance with Meta for the development of 'smart glasses' and is behind the 'RayBan' brand, also very popular in the US.Among the major European luxury firms, LVMH (Louis Vuitton) is the most affected company, with sales down by over 2.6%; followed by Hermés, with losses exceeding 2%, and others such as Pernord Ricard or Loreal also experiencing declines. Consumer-related stocks are also feeling the impact today. This is the case for Prosus (an online commerce company based in the Netherlands), which is down by more than 1.5%; the food giant Danone, or Inditex, which is down by another 0.6%.In the automotive sector, losses are around 4%. This is the case for BMW, Porsche, or Mercedes. Volkswagen is down by nearly 3.5% at the start of the session. The sportswear company Adidas, highly exposed to the US market, is also experiencing losses that have exceeded 4%. In Spain, with no listed automotive companies, the only references in...",

  "text": "Meanwhile, Moscow has kept up its hammering of Ukraine's energy grid in overnight attacks that killed at least two people, according to Ukrainian officials.More than 200,000 households in the Russia-held part of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region had no electricity on Sunday, according to the Kremlin-installed local governor.In a Telegram post, Yevgeny Balitsky said that nearly 400 settlements have had their supply cut, because of damage to power networks from Ukrainian drone strikes.Russia has hammered Ukraine's power grid, especially in winter, throughout the nearly four-year war. The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians' will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call \"weaponizing winter.\"Russia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.At least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country's energy system remains challenging, \"but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.\"He said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.In total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\"If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world's response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.He spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.On Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.If American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.Russia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.Separately, in Russia's Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.Seventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.Russia's Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia's Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.Ukrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.The fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and...",

  "title": "Hassane Kouyaté, the African griot who rubs shoulders with the greats of world theater",
  "text": "At the beginning of The Sinners, one of the box office sensations of 2025 and a strong Oscar contender, Ryan Coogler introduces the figure of the griot as \"people born with the gift of making music so authentic that it can penetrate the veil that separates life and death, invoking spirits of the past and the future, with a gift that brings healing to communities and also attracts demons.\" And one expects the griot who is about to arrive, something like a totemic figure in the countries of West Africa, to appear as a divine apparition. Nothing could be further from the truth.Hassane Kouyaté (1964) speaks with a slow cadence, with a minimal tone of voice and with absolute affability. Born in Burkina Faso, into a family where griots have succeeded each other since the 13th century, this man dressed entirely in navy blue, only altered by a flowery scarf, grew up in his community until at the age of 20 he went to France, following in the footsteps of his father, the actor Sotigui Kouyaté. The son grew in the theater to become - here as well - a totemic figure in this discipline. For years he served as artistic director of Peter Brook's company, a pope of contemporary theater; since 2019 he has been directing the Les Francophonies festival in Limoges and with his works he has traveled through America, Europe, and Africa. He now premieres Where Do We Come From? at the Teatros del Canal, created in collaboration with Santiago Sánchez, director of the L'Om Imprebís company and who acts as a translator in this conversation.\"I am the result of the encounter of wonderful people, of great women and great men, of my mom and my dad to start with. All the people I have met in life have given me good learning. Even those who have hurt me have made me grow. Everything has been the result of encounters. For example, for me to be here today, there was a previous encounter, mine with theater and with Santiago,\" says Kouyaté, whose community role as a griot is to be a historian, mediator, organizer of ceremonies - weddings, funerals...-, teacher, psychologist, and also a political figure. That's why his theater is imbued with that historical and social burden, with Africanist narratives, and of course with his tradition.In Congo Jazz Band, the Burkinabe addressed the violence suffered by Belgian Congo during the colonization years. In Black Star, he explored the life of Marcus Garvey, one of the leaders of 20th-century Pan-Africanism. And now he is finalizing another show about the fight against apartheid of South African singer Miriam Makeba. \"I am still one of the few people who can take a political stance, I have that obligation,\" says the playwright. And he continues: \"As my role as a griot obliges me to be partly a historian, I believe it is important to know where we come from or where the things we have experienced come from. For example,...",

  "text": "The White House this week announced the members of a new Palestinian committee to run Gaza's day to day affairs, along with an executive committee of international experts who will supervise these efforts. They include a high-powered group of people with strong connections across the region and varying degrees of leverage of Israel and Hamas.The entire effort will be overseen by the \"Board of Peace\" — a collection of world leaders led by Trump whose other members still have not been named.Still, this week's appointments mark an important step forward for Trump's ambitious ceasefire plan. The White House this week said the plan had entered its second phase, which includes the new Palestinian committee in Gaza, deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-battered territory.

  "title": "A timeline of how the U.S. and Europe have been at odds",
  "text": "Deep disagreements have flared up from time to time since World War II, bringing trans-Atlantic diplomatic crises.Here's a look at some of them.When France, the United Kingdom and Israel invaded Egypt in 1956, aiming to topple Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and take back control of the Suez Canal, the U.S. employed heavy diplomatic and economic pressure to stop it.The U.S. intervention severely strained Washington's relations with London and Paris, which were key allies during the Cold War, and was a milestone in Europe's waning postwar influence.While European countries except France gave diplomatic backing to the U.S., they refused to provide troops.Street protests in Europe against the war had a significant political cost for the continent's governments, which had to reconcile their support for the U.S. with an erosion of their domestic popularity, and were a burden on trans-Atlantic relations.Russia's deployment of its new SS-20 missiles that could quickly hit targets in Western Europe compelled NATO to install U.S. Pershing nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in Europe in order to maintain the balance of the nuclear arms threat.The move ignited an uproar on the continent, where fears of a new arms race deepened. Huge anti-nuclear peace demonstrations, with protesters often aiming their ire at Washington, filled the streets of European capitals in the 1980s.The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 sparked a major crisis in relations with Europe, especially France and Germany after they refused to support the attack on President Saddam Hussein's government.Washington officials rebuked Paris and Berlin, with U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld referring to them as \"Old Europe\" and praising Eastern European countries as \"New Europe.\"As part of its \"war on terror,\" the United States captured and sometimes kidnapped suspects, and then transferred them to locations in countries where they were interrogated and often tortured outside the reach of U.S. law.While some European governments were complicit in the program, a public outcry forced political leaders to denounce the practice.When U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he upended three years of American policy toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Trump spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was cold toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and then significantly reduced U.S. military aid for Kyiv.Alarmed European leaders, who see their own security at stake in Ukraine, have pressed Trump to be on Ukraine's side.The Trump administration set out a new national security strategy last December that portrayed European allies as weak.It was scathing of their migration and free speech policies, suggested they face the \"prospect of civilizational erasure\" and cast doubt on their long-term reliability as American partners.With relations between the U.S. and Europe deteriorating, Trump threatened the continent last July with heavy trade tariffs in what was seen as a deeply hostile move.Trump initially announced tariffs of 30% on the 27-nation European Union, which is the biggest trading partner of the United States. Both sides later agreed to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods. ( ; } // ### Functions....",

  "title": "The End of an Era: everything revealed (and everything left unsaid) in Taylor Swift's documentary series",
  "text": "Between March 2023 and December 2024, Taylor Swift carried out what can now be considered the most lucrative music tour of all time. She raised about $2 billion and gathered 10 million attendees. Throughout 149 concerts in 21 countries, the artist presented an impressive show of over three hours that served as a monumental overview of her 18-year career. Even for someone not particularly a swiftie, the ins and outs of the creative and logistical process of a tour of this magnitude are fascinating.On December 13, coinciding with the artist's birthday, Disney+ premiered The End of an Era, the documentary series that promised to reveal all the behind-the-scenes secrets of the major musical event of 2023. This celebration was complemented by the release of The Eras Tour: The Final Show, her concert in Vancouver recorded in 4K. However, the six episodes that unravel the intricacies of Taylor Swift's tour fail to fully exploit their potential to captivate those unfamiliar with her, ending up as a rather uniform, even cheesy narrative that hardly resonates with an audience beyond the most devoted fans. And there is little more to discover for those fans.It's not news that Taylor Swift is an expert in monetizing every part of her creative process and packaging it as a mass cultural product, shiny bow included. She did it in 2024 with the Eras Tour movie, which reached cinemas worldwide, and once again with the grand screening of her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl. The film reused the lyric videos of each song along with unseen comments from the artist and teased the music video for the single The Fate of Ophelia a few days before its public release on YouTube. Nothing less, and nothing more.But let's go back to The End of an Era. The first episode delves into the star's room before and after the first of the five concerts she performed at Wembley Stadium, in London. Just a few days earlier, in August 2024, she had to cancel the three scheduled dates in Vienna due to an imminent terrorist threat.\"We narrowly escaped what could have been a massacre. So I've been a bit disoriented,\" recalls Swift sitting on a sofa in her London hotel. And she can't hold back tears when referring to the \"horrible attack\" that had just occurred in the English town of Southport during a themed dance class, where three young girls died: \"I'm going to meet some of the victims' families tonight and then I'm going to perform a pop concert. It's shocking.\"This is just one of the many dramatic peaks of the series, which succeeds precisely in shining a light on what is usually left untold. A feat with no greater glory because it is, in fact, what is expected from a documentary like this: to show the most human side of a mega-tour.The End of an Era achieves this. The Eras Tour, as reiterated countless times throughout the six episodes like a mantra, is not only a...",

  "title": "Trump's voice in a new Fannie Mae ad is generated by artificial intelligence, with his permission",
  "text": "The voice in the ad, created with permission from the Trump administration, promises an \"all new Fannie Mae\" and calls the institution the \"protector of the American Dream.\" The ad comes as the administration is making a big push to show voters it is responding to their concerns about affordability, including in the housing market.Trump plans to talk about housing at his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders and corporate executives meet this week.This isn't the first time a member of the Trump family has used AI to replicate their voice, First Lady Melania Trump recently employed AI technology firm ElevenLabs to help voice the audio version of her memoir. It's not known who cloned President Trump's voice for the Fannie Mae ad. But ElevenLabs said in an email to The Associated Press on Sunday that the audio of Trump's voice wasn't generated by the company.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Last month, Trump pledged in a prime-time address that he would roll out \"some of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history.\"\"For generations, home ownership meant security, independence, and stability,\" Trump's digitized voice says in the one-minute ad aired Sunday. \"But today, that dream feels out of reach for too many Americans not because they stopped working hard but because the system stopped working for them.\"Fannie Mae and its counterpart Freddie Mac, which have been under government control since the Great Recession, buy mortgages that meet their risk criteria from banks, which helps provide liquidity for the housing market. The two firms guarantee roughly half of the $13 trillion U.S. home loan market and are a bedrock of the U.S. economy.The ad says Fannie Mae will work with the banking industry to approve more would-be homebuyers for mortgages.Trump, Bill Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and others have said they want to sell shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a major stock exchange but no concrete plans have been set.Trump and Pulte have also floated extending the 30-year mortgage to 50 years in order to lower monthly payments. Trump appeared to back off the proposal after critics said a longer-term loan would reduce people's ability to create housing equity and increase their own wealth.Trump also said on social media earlier this month that he was directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are anxious about home prices. Trump said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the purchase.Earlier this month, Trump also said he wants to block large institutional investors f rom buying houses, saying that a ban would make it easier for younger families to buy their first homes.Trump's permission for the use of AI is interesting given that he has complained about aides in the Biden administration using autopen to apply the former president's...",

  "title": "DOJ vows to press charges after activists disrupt church where Minnesota ICE official is a pastor",
  "text": "A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good.\" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations \"by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.\"\"A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!\" she said on social media.Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.\"When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,\" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. \"If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.\"The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents \"knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.\"\"Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,\" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. \"They're going from...",

  "title": "Princess Eugenie of York has cut contact with her father, Andrew Mountbatten, due to his involvement in the 'Epstein case'",
  "text": "Princess Eugenie avoids any contact with her father, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, following the recent scandal linking him to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which led to the removal of his royal titles, as reported by the British tabloid Daily Mail on Sunday.Eugenie, who still holds the title of princess as the granddaughter of the late Queen Elizabeth II, refuses to speak with her father and did not visit him during Christmas. \"There is no contact whatsoever, nothing. It's Brooklyn Beckham level. She has completely cut him off,\" said a source quoted in the English tabloid, drawing a comparison with the disagreements within the Beckham family.Andrew, brother of King Charles III, is said to be \"devastated\" by the estrangement from his younger daughter, according to the mentioned source. The situation is believed to have resulted from new information that came to light about the close relationship between Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein through emails last October.Likewise, Andrew's downfall and the stripping of his royal titles and honors (from prince to Duke of York, among others) occurred after the posthumous memoirs of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's alleged victims, were released, accusing Queen Elizabeth II's son of sexually abusing her when she was a minor.Andrew, up to this point, continues to deny all accusations against him. Eugenie, who founded the Anti-Slavery Collective to help combat sex trafficking, would view her father's refusal to apologize to Epstein's victims unfavorably.On the other hand, Andrew's elder daughter, Princess Beatrice, \"is trying to strike a balance between not isolating her father and at the same time remaining close to the royal family,\" as indicated by sources cited by Daily Mail.Both of Andrew's daughters spent Christmas with the rest of the royal family in Sandringham (eastern England), invited by King Charles III, while their father was urged to stay in London during the festive season.The breakdown in relations between Andrew and Princess Eugenie marks another blow for the disgraced former prince as he prepares to leave Royal Lodge, the estate near Windsor Castle where he has lived for two decades, to move to a new property in Sandringham, reports Efe.

  "text": "The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of \"improving the state of the world,\" and this year's theme is \"A spirit of dialogue.\" One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them.Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries.\"It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,\" said Mirek Duek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. \"Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.\"Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike.Trump's peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his \" Board of Peace \" for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center.The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics.Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, will be on hand.The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day of the event: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's \"economic czar\" — as Duek put it.The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge.This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies - along with some celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon.The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes.The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand.Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer - launched...",

Волошин підкреслив, що росіяни не можуть захопити місто, тому вони вдаються до мінування. « Ворог не може відтіснити і закріпитися в Гуляйполі, тому… саперні підрозділи противника отримали значну кількість і протипіхотних, і протитанкових мін ТМ-72 для того, щоб замінувати всі дороги, вулиці, подвір'я», — заявив Волошин, уточнивши, що мінування здійснюється як вручну, так і дистанційно — з використанням дронів. Читайте також: Він також зазначив, що ситуація в районі Гуляйполя залишається напруженою вже кілька тижнів. Щодня відбуваються десятки боїв як в самому місті, так і в прилеглих населених пунктах. За минулу добу на цьому напрямку зафіксовано рекордну кількість авіаударів — 14, зокрема з використанням 106 коригованих авіаційних бомб. Залізничне зазнало значних руйнувань, «фактично рівняється із землею». Також активно застосовуються дрони: за минулу добу було зафіксовано 1752 дрони-камікадзе, з яких мінімум 1200 — на Гуляйполі, — повідомив Волошин. 27 грудня 2025 року Генштаб ЗСУ спростував заяви Росії про захоплення Гуляйполя, Мирнограда і Покровська . У повідомленні зазначалося, що окупантам не вдається реалізувати плани із захоплення Покровсько-Мирноградської агломерації. 28 грудня Сили оборони Півдня заявили, що Гуляйполе і Степногірськ частково перебувають під контролем російських військ , і ситуація там складна, але бої за ці міста тривають.

  "text": "Оновлено . Як повідомляє Суспільне , суд оголосив перерву у розгляді клопотання до 13:30 вівторка, 20 січня. Суспільне зазначає, що на початку засідання Тимошенко стверджувала, що система НАБУ, САП та ВАКС діє як «єдиний механізм політичних репресій». Реклама Вона заявила про можливе втручання в систему авторозподілу суддів. За її версією, прокурор нібито знав прізвище головуючого судді ще до того, як система офіційно провела розподіл справи. «Це означає, що і минулий склад суду, і цей склад суду є незаконним. І тому всі рішення, які були прийняті внаслідок цього, є незаконними. Ми не заявляємо відвід зараз, бо готуємо детальні документи для звернення до Моніторингового комітету ПАРЄ та апеляції», — сказала нардепка. Читайте також: Прокурор САП попросив суд провести засідання у закритому режимі заради захисту таємниці слідства та персональних даних. Суддя підтримав це рішення. Водночас адвокати Тимошенко наполягали на відкритому засідання, «щоб уся країна бачила, що насправді відбувається у цьому процесі». Раніше адвокати заперечували обґрунтованість підозри, яку отримала політикиня, називаючи справу « політичним замовленням». Сама Тимошенко під час засідань стверджувала, що знайдені під час обшуків гроші є «родинними заощадженнями», а робочі документи та телефони були вилучені начебто без належних підстав. Читайте також: Тимошенко підозрюється у наданні хабарів депутатам за голосування у Верховній Раді. 14 січня НАБУ опублікувало аудіозаписи, на яких голос жінки, що, ймовірно належить депутатці, обговорює суми та дає вказівки — голосувати за чи проти конкретного законопроєкту, зокрема що стосується призначень чи відставок. Під час засідання ВАКС 16 січня Тимошенко заявила, що ще один нардеп на плівках НАБУ — це «слуга народу» Ігор Копитін , який, за її словами, влаштував « провокацію» проти неї на замовлення бюро. Вона відкинула усі звинувачення у корупції і назвала аудіо НАБУ неправдивим. Політикині загрожує до 10 років позбавлення волі з конфіскацією майна ( ч. 4 ст. 369 КК України). ВАКС обрав Тимошенко запобіжний захід у вигляді застави у сумі 33 мільйони 280 тисяч гривень . Нардепка заявила, що оскаржуватиме рішення суду й звернеться « до друзів і колег» щодо застави.",

  "text": "MIAMI — The Post breaks down Monday night’s national championship game between No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami at Hard Rock Stadium. When Indiana has the ball: Indiana can beat you on the ground and through the air. The Hoosiers have the Heisman Trophy winner and almost certain No. 1 pick in the draft in quarterback Fernando Mendoza, but what makes this offense so dangerous is its unpredictability. They have a stellar 1-2 running back duo in Roman Hemby and Kaelon Black, and five receivers who caught at least 30 balls for 370 yards. The Hurricanes get after the quarterback — their 47 sacks led the nation — and the duo of Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are elite at getting home, combining for 19 sacks. Indiana, though, is stout up front — the Hoosiers were a finalist for the Joe Moore Award, given to the best offensive line — and Mendoza gets the ball out fast. Edge: Indiana When Miami has the ball: The Indiana offense has been so dynamic and consistent, the defense has gone overlooked. That shouldn’t be the case. The Hoosiers are incredibly good on that side of the ball. They are ranked second in points allowed, second against the run and 23rd against the pass. This unit shut down Ohio State, Alabama and Oregon in its last three games, and produced 29 takeaways, third most in the nation. It will be fascinating to see if Miami and star back Mark Fletcher Jr. (395 yards on the ground in three playoff games) can run the ball against the Hoosiers. The Hurricanes offense can be hit or miss. Quarterback Carson Beck and Co. have turned it on of late, putting up strong numbers against Ohio State and Ole Miss.",

Josh Shapirohas claimed in his forthcoming memoir that2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’campaign asked him if he had ever worked as a “double agent for Israel” while vetting him as a potential running mate. Shapiro, who is Jewish, wrote in “Where We Keep the Light” that he told his interrogator, former Biden White House Counsel Dana Remus, that he found the question offensive and was told, “Well, we have to ask.” 4 Then-Vice President Kamala Harris with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro during a campaign stop on July 13, 2024.AFP via Getty Images 4 Governor Josh Shapiro was considered by the Harris team to be her running mate.AP According toThe New York Times, which obtained an advance copy of Shapiro’s book, Remus then asked if the governor had ever “communicated with an undercover agent of Israel.” “If they were undercover, I responded, how the hell would I know?” wrote Shapiro, who is thought by some observers to be a contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination.

While the Keystone State governor declined to directly criticize Remus, who he said was “just doing her job,” Shapiro wrote that the line of questioning “said a lot about some of the people around the VP.” “I wondered,” he admitted in the book, “whether these questions were being posed to just me — the only Jewish guy in the running — or if everyone who had not held a federal office was being grilled about Israel in the same way.” 4 Josh Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 2024. He wasn’t chosen as Harris’ running mate.Bloomberg via Getty Images Harris herself, Shapiro went on, asked the governor point-blank if he would “be willing to apologize” for statements criticizingantisemitic demonstrations on college campuses following the Hamas terror attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Shapiro declined to do so, writing, according to the Times: “I believe in free speech, and I’ll defend it with all I’ve got. Most of the speech on campus, even that which I disagreed with, was peaceful and constitutionally protected. But some wasn’t peaceful.” The 52-year-old previously slammed Harris for her description of him in her campaign memoir, “107 Days,” released last year. In that book, Harris described the Pennsylvania governor as fixated on the perks of the vice presidency, asking how many bedrooms the official residence at the Naval Observatory contained, and musing about whether the Smithsonian would lend Keystone State art for display.

  "text": "You’ve likely heard of diabetes, a chronic condition that affects how the body regulates blood sugar. But are you familiar with prediabetes? Prediabetes is a state of elevated blood sugar that falls below the threshold of Type 2 diabetes. It’s becoming increasingly common: More than 1 in 3 US adults has prediabetes, and most aren’t aware of it. Elevated blood sugar can eventually lead to insulin resistance. Insulin’s job is to help glucose enter muscle and fat cells, where it’s used for energy or stored for later. If insulin isn’t working effectively or there isn’t enough of it, blood sugar levels rise. Over time, this can damage blood vessels and arteries. That’s why prediabetes significantly increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes. Here are some strategies to stop prediabetes in its tracks, including how to use GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic effectively. Explore More I’m a doctor — 5 major lessons we can learn from people who live past 100 Beware this common disease that attacks from the inside — and the bad habit worsening it I’m a neurologist — 6 easy ways to boost your brain over the holidays, especially if you’re lonely What are the symptoms of prediabetes? The symptoms of diabetes can include frequent urination, excessive thirst or hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet and unexplained weight loss. Prediabetes typically has no symptoms, which is why people don’t realize they have it unless they’re tested. How is prediabetes diagnosed? During your annual physical, you can ask your provider to include a hemoglobin A1C test in your blood work. The A1C test reveals your average blood sugar over the past three months. Prediabetes is defined as an A1C between 5.7% and 6.4%. An A1C of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. An A1C test from a finger prick can reveal your average blood sugar over the past three months.Stock photo In most cases, it takes several years for someone to progress from prediabetes to diabetes, though the timeline varies by age. Adults in their 70s and older are often more likely to remain in the prediabetes range or even return to normal blood sugar levels than to progress to Type 2 diabetes. Why are the rates of prediabetes increasing? The risk of developing prediabetes or diabetes is influenced by genetics and environment. While we can’t change our genetics, we can change environmental factors — such as the foods we eat and our level of physical activity. One of the biggest risk factors for prediabetes is weight gain. Over the past several decades, rates of obesity have risen dramatically in the US and worldwide. Excess weight drives insulin resistance, which can lead to prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. The fastest rise in prediabetes diagnoses has occurred in young adults and adolescents, which is particularly concerning. Earlier onset means longer exposure to diabetes and a higher lifetime risk of cardiovascular complications. Can prediabetes be reversed with diet? Yes — prediabetes can often be...",

  "text": "Why are American progressives, who believe in gay rights and abortion, aligned with radical Islamists, who want a religious dictatorship? Because “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” writes Peter Schweizer in his new book, “The Invisible Coup: How American Elites and Foreign Powers Use Immigration as a Weapon.” In this exclusive excerpt, he explains that they are after the same thing: the destruction of Western society from within. Ismail Selim Elbarasse, an accountant by training, seemed to be living a quiet life in Annandale, Virginia. But in 2004, when police officers noticed him driving with his wife across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and filming its critical structural elements, they decided to act, then detained him and notified federal agents. He was already a suspect in a scheme to provide funding to Islamist terrorist groups, and now agents were searching through his home for further evidence of his possible involvement. They discovered far more than a terrorism funding scheme. 7 Peter Schweizer’s new book, “The Invisible Coup: How American Elites and Foreign Powers Use Immigration as a Weapon,” explores the link between radical Islamists and progressives in America. Buried among the stacks of paperwork in his home was a Aleida even wore a head covering during the meeting. At a meeting with the Iranian minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Mohammad-Hossein Saffar-Harandi, it was declared that the common goal was to fight America “everywhere and all the time.” It is just that simple. 7 Activist Linda Sarsour and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Sixteenth Annual Universal Muslim Association of America in 2018, where they talked about progressive values before an audience that segregated men and women.X/mtgreenee Perhapsprominent progressive-Islamic activist Linda Sarsourpersonifies the merging of these two movements best. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised by Palestinian parents, Sarsour became a prominent activist during the Obama years when she was regularly invited to meetings at the White House. In 2012, President Barack Obama gave her the “Champions of Change” award at a White House ceremony. Sarsour sits on the board of the New York Immigration Coalition, which includes 200 groups, and was the head of the Arab American Association of New York. In 2017, she helped organize the massive “Women’s March” in Washington and later became a campaign surrogate for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. 7 A flyer promoting Ocasio-Cortez’s appearance with Sarsour at the 2018 Universal Muslim Association convention. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has aligned herself with Sarsour, headlining together the Sixteenth Annual Universal Muslim Association of America, as “the two took the stage to promote women’s rights and progressive values.” The event reportedly segregated men and women in attendance, and most women wore hijabs, but that did not seem to bother the congresswoman. To Sarsour, the founder of the Muslim faith, Muhammad, was a progressive activist. “Our prophet was a racial justice activist, a human rights activist, a feminist in his own right,” she said. “He was a man that cared about the environment.

  "title": "Four ways to reduce prison overcrowding, without building new jails",
  "text": "A slew of reports from the Office of the Inspector of Prisons was published late last week. They exert a powerful cumulative impact, painting a vivid picture of severely overcrowded prisons where men and women, many of whom struggle with addiction and mental illness, languish in squalid conditions, their treatment needs unmet. How did we arrive at such a parlous situation and how might we navigate our way out of it? What can be done to ensure imprisonment is used sparingly and the conditions of confinement are decent and humane? The Government seems to think it can build its way out of the crisis, promising to construct a new prison at Thornton Hall and to expand capacity by 1,500 places. Given the enormous cost overruns associated with capital projects ranging from the Leinster House bicycle shed to the National Children’s Hospital , we should brace ourselves for a gigantic bill if the Government’s building programme goes ahead. This is not the first time the prison population has surged. It rose steadily between 2005 and 2011, but a very different approach was taken back then. A subcommittee on penal reform was established by the Oireachtas to consider what could be done. It noted that imprisonment rates had a very small impact on crime rates and rather than calling for expansion, it advocated restraint, recommending that the Government aim to reduce the prison population by one-third. The subcommittee’s work coincided with a fall in prisoner numbers that continued for several years .

Since January 2022, the number in custody has risen from 3,708 to 5,755, more than 600 of whom are sleeping on mattresses on cell floors because no beds can be found for them. This is unprecedented. Politicians are in the habit of saying the increase in imprisonment reflects demographic change, that there is a certain inevitability about the trend. While Ireland’s population may have risen steeply, there is no simple relationship between the number of people living in a country and the number of prisoners. The latter depends on crime rates, victims’ propensity to report, investigative efficiency, prosecution practice, sentences imposed, early release mechanisms, political priorities and the legislative environment. The fact that the national population has been on an upward trajectory at the same time as the number of prisoners has fluctuated shows this correlation is imperfect. The number of women in prison is a case in point. In January 2022, there were 139 female prisoners. Last week, there were 309. Obviously, the number of women in Ireland has not doubled over the past four years. The Council...",

  "title": "Fears about Mercosur trade deal ‘unfounded’, says Michael McGrath",
  "text": "Fears that the Mercosur trade deal will devastate the Irish beef industry will turn out to be “unfounded”, the Republic’s EU commissioner Michael McGrath has said. The free trade agreement negotiated between the European Commission and the South American bloc was the “strongest deal possible”, and included solid safeguards protecting Irish farmers, said the former Fianna Fáil minister. The controversial deal will lower tariffs and other barriers to trade between EU countries and Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, opening up a significant new South American market for European industry. Could Coalition politics hurt Ireland’s influence in Brussels? Listen | Farmers have fiercely opposed the trade agreement, fearing exports of Irish beef will suffer in the face of competition from cheaper South American steaks and burgers produced to lower standards.

Mr McGrath, EU commissioner for consumer protection, said the trade deal would be a “net positive overall” for the Republic as an export-driven economy and would also end up benefiting agriculture. “The concern of the agri-food sector will not crystallise in the fullness of time,” he said. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen signed the Mercosur trade deal in Paraguay on Saturday. The agreement was backed by a large number of EU states, providing a big enough majority for its approval, despite the opposition of the Republic, France, Poland, Austria and Hungary. “There’s no denying that there is disappointment within the commission at Ireland’s No vote,” said Mr McGrath. Commission negotiators had worked “very hard” to strengthen the proposed trade agreement and tighten protections for farmers, he said. The deal includes an emergency brake that the EU can pull to reimpose steep tariffs if South American beef is found to be flooding any part of the market and causing a drop in prices. The commission has separately said dairy farmers could be one of the winners out of the deal, selling into the South American market. The trade pact still needs to be ratified by MEPs in the European Parliament before it comes into full effect. That vote is expected in the coming weeks and will be very tight. “We’re not taking the vote in the European Parliament for granted,” said Mr McGrath. He said he was not aware of any talk about a “quid pro quo” between the recent leeway the commission granted Ireland on nitrates rules around fertiliser spreading and the Government’s vote on the Mercosur deal.

  "title": "Data centres leap back into business under a new Government policy",
  "text": "L ast week, Government published its new data centre industry plan, otherwise known as LEAP, or Large Energy User Action Plan . This plan has been lobbied for and anticipated by the industry in a country where 22 per cent of all metered electricity is used by data centres, rising to around 50 per cent in Dublin. Until a few years ago, Government policy on data centres was not LEAP, but LTAI (Let Them At It). Then reality hit. The subsequent so-called moratorium on data centres was not a pause on construction, but on connections to the electricity grid. Even so, one of the largest projects still went ahead, Echelon’s data centre in Wicklow. Ironically, the data centre industry became a victim of the very pathologies within our political system of stasis, ad hoc planning and myopia, which led to the Irish data centre boom in the first place. That boom was catalysed by a 2018 policy statement by Heather Humphreys , then minister for business, enterprise and innovation, bowing it appeared to the data centre industry’s desires. Once the electricity grid was inevitably squeezed by unfettered development, and the alarms sounded, the Government was cornered. Now it is trying to back itself out of that corner.

There’s the intention to “unlock regional economic opportunities”, meaning more data centres in rural Ireland. The development of hyperscale data centres in rural parts of the US is facing backlash regarding water availability, land use, negative environmental consequences and rising household electricity bills. There is a vigorous nod to embedding data centre industry lobbying further in Government decisions through establishing a “data centre sector round-table”. This is a forum for the data centre industry, Government departments and energy system operators to “receive sector feedback and escalate challenges”. Legislating for private wires policy is in the actions section of the plan. Realistically, restarting Ireland’s data centre boom cannot happen without it. It marks a huge change in Ireland’s electricity infrastructure policy, where data centre developers will build private infrastructure to circumvent the grid, and connect directly to private energy sources. Government intends to legislate in 2026. This will have a large knock-on effect on everything from agricultural land to the development and ownership of large-scale renewable energy projects. What represents the largest industrial roll-out this country has ever seen, in terms of pace, scale and energy usage, occurred relatively quietly. It...",

Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said the US president’s plan for postwar Gaza had been discussed at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Sunday. Israel has already raised concerns about some of Mr Trump’s plans for the make-up of the board, which is a part of the American president’s 20 point peace plan for the Middle East .

Ms McEntee said the United Nations “has a unique mandate to maintain international peace and security, and the legitimacy to bring nations together to find common solutions to shared challenges”. “While it may be imperfect, the UN and the primacy of international law is more important now than ever. Ireland’s commitment to the UN and the primacy of the UN Charter is without question,” she said. “Ireland has received an invitation from the United States to participate in the proposed Board of Peace. We will need to give this careful consideration. In doing so, we will co-ordinate closely with our EU and wider European partners. “It is essential for attention to remain focused on Gaza and on the full implementation of phase two of the peace plan. This is central to achieving progress on the ground and to supporting a sustainable path forward.” Only Hungary, whose leader is a close Trump ally, gave an unequivocal acceptance in response to the invitations, which have been addressed to some 60 nations and began arriving in European capitals on Saturday, according to diplomats. Other governments appeared ‍reluctant to make public statements, leaving officials to express concerns anonymously about the impact on the work of the UN. The board would be chaired for life by Mr Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters. Canada’s prime minister Mark Carney said on Sunday he had agreed to Mr Trump’s board of peace for Gaza in principle ⁠although details were still being worked out. A mandate for a board of peace was authorised by the United Nations Security Council in November, but only through 2027 and solely focused on the Gaza conflict.

We’ll be sending out this briefing to everyone who has signed up to the newsletter every week the Dáil is sitting. Greenland row poses problems for Emerald Isle There is just no getting away from the US president. Donald Trump just doesn’t take a day off. As the third full week of the year begins, he again looks set to cast a long shadow over politics both foreign and domestic. His declaration on Saturday of fresh tariffs on Denmark and the seven Nato countries that are lending military support to their Danish allies in Greenland risks bringing US-EU relations to an unprecedented low – if not a fundamental fracture. READ MORE Coco’s Law may be strengthened in Government bid to tackle AI deepfakes Trump’s tariff and Greenland threats against EU put Ireland in an uncomfortable position Derailing US-EU trade deal ‘would have significant implications’ for Ireland Fears about Mercosur trade deal ‘unfounded’, says Michael McGrath The countries in question – Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden – have warned of a dangerous “downward spiral” as a result of this renewed US economic aggression – and that they will “stand together” against it. So will it be “Boston or Berlin” for Ireland? According to Taoiseach Michéal Martin , perhaps unsurprisingly, it remains both. For the time being, at least. With several European leaders seemingly resigned to putting the transatlantic trade deal that was agreed last summer on ice, the message from Martin has essentially been “steady on lads, not so hasty”. Speaking on RTÉ’s This Week programme yesterday he called Trump’s threats “unacceptable” but warned against any “knee-jerk” actions that could blow apart the “Turnberry” trade deal agreed in Scotland. Such reaction may include deployment of the EU’s so-called “trade bazooka” – the anti-coercion instrument (ACI). The French are reportedly looking to lock and load that particular piece of hardware – the firing of which would limit US access to European markets, make American tech bros very unhappy and put Ireland in a rather tricky spot altogether. Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews, however, has had enough with the “appeasement” of Trump and is calling for Europe to take the shot. As of last night, calm seems to be prevailing in Brussels. Following a hastily arranged meeting of EU ambassadors it appears there is no immediate plan to break open the trade armoury. The ACI – and €93 billion of retaliatory tariffs – remain in reserve for now. Getting quick agreement on the best way to put some manners on the US president will be no easy task. With lots of talk about Neville Chamberlain tribute acts, just how hard it will be to sell the Irish message of “careful now” remains to be seen. Tánaiste and Minister for Finance Simon Harris will presumably convey that position to his European counterparts today when they meet in Brussels. An emergency meeting of the 27 EU leaders...",

  "text": "T rying to understand Donald Trump has become a high-stakes intellectual sport. Is he an evil genius? Or a grossly insecure man-child? Is he a neo-fascist? Or a useful idiot for Big Tech? Maybe he’s a bit of all of the above. I have my own theory: Donald Trump is 95 per cent cat. I reached this conclusion after reading John Gray’s Feline Philosophy: Cats and The Meaning of Life – a welcome Christmas stocking filler over the festive period. Ostensibly exploring the differences between cats and humans, the book centres on the work of Baruch Spinoza , the 17 th century Enlightenment thinker. Spinoza is regarded as a founder of modern atheism. He rejected the Judaism of his birth and the Christian theology of his day to construct a naturalistic understanding of human beings and our place in the universe. Humans are animals, God is nature: These two propositions sum up his philosophy, which was admired by great minds from Albert Einstein to Jeeves from the PG Wodehouse novels.

Well, Spinoza tells us that humans have animal instincts because we can’t be divorced from nature. Chief among these instincts is what he called conatus – a “striving” or “effort” within all living things to enhance or preserve their activity in the world. Humans are inherently trying “to maintain and extend their power”, Gray notes. This goes for someone devoted to charitable works or social justice campaigning as much as for someone dedicated to accumulating wealth or building empires. Spinoza argues that Christian morality denies our true nature. Instead of embracing the conatus within, we are taught to feel guilty about our desires and to feel shame for wanting power. “Spinoza’s ethics diverges from traditional morality in not being composed of rules or laws handed down by some human or divine authority,” Gray explains. “It also views virtues and vices differently. Pity is a vice because it is a cause of sorrow and depletes vitality.” Trump may know nothing of Spinoza – the 47 th US president says he doesn’t read books – but he acts like an animal whose conatus is off the leash. He is following his natural instincts and proud of it. He appears incapable of feeling shame and, crucially, is disdainful of established legal and moral codes. No man-made law should halt his onward prowl. Trump said as much in a recent interview with the New York Times. Downplaying the need to obey international law, he said there was only “one thing” that put a limit on his powers: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that...",

US president Donald Trump ’s bullish efforts to “buy” Greenland are, he claims, motivated by his desire to protect the western hemisphere from the security threat posed by China and Russia. Yet, at the weekend he became the sole architect of an act of diplomatic cannibalism on Nato. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin must be really enjoying watching the American and European alliance eat itself. The US president is determined to gain an island, even at the cost of losing the world. Ireland, which is not a member of Nato, is of course not included in the eight countries which are now being threatened with 10 per cent and possibly even 25 per cent tariffs on goods exported to the US. Those countries were specifically chosen by Trump in retaliation to a comparatively small Nato military exercise carried out in Greenland last week. Ironically, some within Europe had thought the exercise might appease Trump – who had been loudly complaining that he felt Nato’s security presence in the Arctic was little more than a couple of dogsleds. Instead “Mister Tariffs”, as he christened himself on Truth Social, perceived it as a slight. But by Sunday morning, it was quite clear that the 27 member states of the European Union saw this new act of unprecedented transatlantic acrimony as one that is as much about EU-US trade as it is about relations within Nato .

Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee framed Trump’s jaw-dropping announcement as one that threatens the basic principles of international law and sovereignty – an issue that Ireland is more than entitled to express a position on given its UN membership. Once again, Ireland’s military neutrality was exposed as being distinctly different from political neutrality as McEntee said that “Denmark and Greenland of course have the sovereign right to arrange military exercises with their partners, on their own territory”.

  "title": "Gobierno alista borrador de decreto para repatriar fondos de pensiones en el exterior",
  "text": "El ministro de Hacienda, Gemán Ávila, confirmó que se publicará el decreto con el cual se busca repatriar billones de las pensiones del extranjero. Este tema revivió en la agenda del Gobierno el 31 de diciembre de 2025, cuando el jefe de cartera anunció que repatriarán $125 billones de ahorros que están en fondos de pensiones privados.Este proyecto de decreto estaría listo hoy y se publicaría para recibir comentarios del público, una vez cuente con la revisión del Ministerio de Hacienda y de la Superintendencia Financiera. Sin embargo, las críticas han llovido el primero de diciembre. La exdirectora de la Unidad de Proyección Normativa y Estudios de Regulación Financiera, URF, Mónica Higuera Garzón, y el presidente de Asofondos, Andrés Velasco, han asegurado que traer esa inversión expondría el ahorro de los trabajadores a mayores riesgos y a una menor rentabilidad.De hecho, Velasco aseguró que obligar a los fondos a traer al país recursos actualmente invertidos en mercados internacionales sería una decisión difícil de justificar desde el punto de vista técnico. “No entendemos qué se pretende lograr. Esto no genera más ahorro en la economía; por el contrario, reduce la diversificación de los portafolios y expone el ahorro de los trabajadores a mayores riesgos y a una menor rentabilidad”, afirmó.Gráfico LRDe hecho, Velasco también presentó un ejercicio contrafactual para ilustrar el efecto de la diversificación internacional. “$1 millón invertido en 2011, con la posibilidad de diversificar en el exterior, hoy valdría cerca de $3,23 millones, con un retorno promedio de 8,5% y un riesgo bajo. Si ese mismo recurso solo se hubiera invertido en activos locales, hoy sería de aproximadamente $1,67 millones, con un retorno de 3,8% y el doble de riesgo”, explicó. En la práctica, añadió, se estaría perdiendo cerca de la mitad del retorno.Hoy los fondos administran cerca de $500 billones, de los cuales alrededor de $250 billones están invertidos en el exterior. Traer $125 billones significaría repatriar casi la mitad de esos recursos. Frente a las versiones que hablan de una eventual repatriación de hasta $125 billones, Velasco fue enfático en señalar que se trata de cifras especulativas.Por su parte, Higuera ha manifestado que esta medida no sería beneficiosa para el sistema pensional. \"Está invertido en productos de mediano y largo plazo con penalización por retiro anticipado o que aún no llegan a su curva de maduración\", dijo sobre los recursos.Agregó que el principal riesgo es la liquidez. \"He usado una analogía sencilla: es como pretender consumir de inmediato toda la cava de un restaurante. El sistema no tiene la capacidad para absorber eso sin generar distorsiones graves. Traer recursos invertidos a largo plazo, en activos ilíquidos y con compromisos contractuales, genera pérdidas, penalidades y presiones indebidas sobre el mercado local. Eso afecta directamente a los afiliados\", agregó.Los riesgosEl directivo advirtió que la repatriación forzada implicaría vender activos rentables en el exterior, en muchos casos de manera apresurada. “Cuando a uno lo obligan a vender, le toca vender barato. Luego esos dólares entrarían a presionar una revaluación de...",

Esto se habría dado en el sector Universidad del Quindío . La Procuraduría Provincial de Instrucción de Armenia señaló que se habría volteado la prenda reflectiva con el fin de no ser identificado en el marco de los disturbios y restablecimiento del orden público en el sector , una conducta \"con la que pudo haber incumplido las instrucciones relativas al servicio\". El ente indicó que el policía hizo parte de la reacción motorizada que acompañó las movilizaciones y que, al parecer, actuó en contravía a las órdenes que le habían sido impartidas por sus superiores . De acuerdo con la Procuraduría, \"por la posible desatención de las instrucciones, que iban dirigidas a una actuación transparente, honesta y leal del cuerpo policial, el patrullero pudo quebrantar el cumplimiento de sus funciones, por lo que de manera provisional calificó el presunto comportamiento como falta disciplinaria como grave cometida a título de dolo\" .",

  "text": "Anoche se conocieron los resultados de la Gran Encuesta que realizó GAD3 Colombia S.A.S para Noticias RCN, La FM, Alerta y La República. En cuanto a la situación del país, los encuestados calificaron la situación política como buena (20%), regular (41%) y mala (34%). En relación con el tema económico, 23% cree que es bueno, 48% lo calificó de regular y 28%, malo. Una pregunta relevante realizada dentro de la Gran Encuesta es si aprueba o desaprueba la captura de Nicolás Maduro por parte de EE.UU.: 66% de los encuestados la aprueba, 16% la desaprueba y 18% no sabe o no responde.   En el aspecto político, Iván Cepeda lidera la intención de voto ante la pregunta “¿por quién votaría para presidente si las elecciones fueran mañana?”, con un porcentaje de 30%. En segundo lugar se ubica Abelardo De La Espriella, con 22%; y en la tercera casilla está Paloma Valencia, candidata del Centro Democrático5, con 3%. Tras los tres primeros lugares, aparecen otros candidatos como Juan Manuel Galán (2%), Vicky Dávila (2%), Juan Carlos Pinzón(2%) y Sergio Fajardo (1%). Se midió, además, la intención de los colombianos por su preferencia en cuanto al candidato de la Gran Consulta por Colombia, que se realizará el 8 de marzo. Los resultados arrojaron a Paloma Valencia como ganadora (23%), seguida de Vicky Dávila (8%), Juan Manuel Galán (8%), Juan Carlos Pinzón (6%) y Juan Daniel Oviedo (4%). En cuanto al candidato del Frente Amplio, el resultado mostró a Iván Cepeda con 34% y en segundo lugar a Roy Barreras, con 4%. Un punto clave son los escenarios en segunda vuelta. Frente a la eventualidad de que lleguen Cepeda y De La Espriella, la Gran Encuesta mostró que 40% votaría por el candidato de izquierda, con 40%; y 32% lo haría por el abogado, mientras que 11% sufragaría en blanco y 10% no votaría. En relación a los escenarios en esta instancia, también se midieron varias llaves. Los resultados en estas evidencian que Cepeda supera a Fajardo con 40% frente a 25%; y si se enfrentara con Paloma, sigue ganando Cepeda con 43%, contra 20% de la senadora. La intención directa de voto al Congreso fue otra de las mediciones. Ante la pregunta “¿por qué partido político es más probable que vote usted?”, 23% lo haría por el Pacto Histórico; 15%, Centro Democrático; Liberal, 7%; Cambio Radical, 4%; y Conservador, 2%.",

  "text": "La Gran Encuesta que realizó GAD3 Colombia S.A.S para Noticias RCN, La FM, Alerta y La República reveló la encuesta presidencial de cara a las elecciones de este año. El sondeo arrojó que si mañana fueran los comicios, Iván Cepeda sería el nuevo presidente de la República, con 30% de los votos. En la contienda siguen Abelardo de la Espriella y Paloma Valencia, con 22% y 3% de las papeletas, respectivamente . Les siguen Juan Manuel Galán (2%); Vicky Dávila (2%); Juan Carlos Pinzón (2%); y Sergio Fajardo (1%). Se revelaron otros temas clave: los posibles escenarios para una segunda vuelta, probabilidad de acudir a las urnas el 31 de mayo y la aprobación o rechazo sobre la captura de Nicolás Maduro a inicios de enero. “Sobre el ambiente electoral, la sociedad está polarizada. Es un ambiente complejo, hay dos extremos muy radicales y una serie de personas indiferentes”. “Es una elección que va a ser muy relevante, porque temas que en su momento no han sido muy importantes, como política exterior, van a tener preponderancia”. Cepeda sería la continuación del gobierno progresista de Gustavo Petro. E l candidato ganó la consulta interna del Pacto Histórico el pasado 26 de octubre con 65,51% de los votos: alrededor de 1.074 millones de sufragios . Superó a sus pares Carolina Corcho y Daniel Quintero en esa disputa interna partidista. Hijo de Manuel Cepeda Vargas, miembro asesinado de la Unión Patriótica, UP, ha sido un fuerte detractor de otras figuras de la derecha colombiana e incluso llevó a los estrados judiciales a Álvaro Uribe Vélez. Cepeda tiene una trayectoria de más de 15 años en el Congreso de la República y llegó a la consulta gracias a Gustavo Bolívar, Susana Muhamad, Gloria Inés Ramírez, entre otras figuras que impulsaron su candidatura como precandidato. En cuanto a Abelardo de la Espriella, sorprendió que el abogado entregase a inicios de diciembre del año pasado alrededor de 4,6 millones de firmas, más que suficientes para hacer parte de la contienda electoral. Su ascenso como figura política relevante en el panorama de las elecciones inició en redes sociales, donde mostró sus posturas y su crítica abierta contra el gobierno de Gustavo Petro y su posible sucesor en la Casa de Nariño. Con su movimiento, “Defensores de la Patria” consolidó una red de seguidores y posibles votantes para este año. Paloma Valencia fue elegida por el Centro Democrático a mediados de diciembre para ser la candidata presidencial en los comicios de mayo. La abogada de 47 años estuvo por encima de María Fernanda Cabal y Paola Holguín. La candidata asegura que la juventud y la educación serán claves en su gobierno, así como el apoyo a las mujeres y a los emprendedores. Manuel Camilo González, profesor de Relaciones Internacionales de la Universidad Javeriana, aseguró que el ambiente electoral está sumamente polarizado, pese a que hay una derecha más hacia el centro y partidaria, incluso “moderada”. “Hay una candidatura de izquierda con Iván Cepeda y otra de derecha más...",

  "title": "Con 23%, el Pacto Histórico es el partido que tiene la preferencia para el Congreso",
  "text": "El 8 de marzo no solo se conmemorará el Día de la Mujer; también será una fecha decisiva para el civismo y la política en Colombia, pues ese día se llevarán a cabo las elecciones al Congreso, en las que se elegirán los congresistas que durante los próximos cuatro años tendrán a su cargo la discusión y aprobación de las leyes del país. En medio de ese ambiente electoral, la Gran Encuesta que realizó GAD3 Colombia S.A.S para Noticias RCN, La FM, Alerta y La República proyecta cómo podría quedar conformado el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes para el nuevo periodo legislativo, que probablemente estaría liderado por el partido de Gustavo Petro, Pacto Histórico. Actualmente hay 3.144 candidatos agrupados en 524 listas que compiten por las 286 curules del Congreso: 183 en la Cámara de Representantes y 103 en el Senado. De acuerdo con el sondeo que tomó en cuenta la percepción de cientos de ciudadanos, se evidencia la mayoría que tendría el Pacto Histórico, el mapa político estaría marcado por el partido de izquierda, que tendría 23% de participación en el Congreso. Entonces, por segundas elecciones legislativas la izquierda tendría gran relevancia, porque hay que recordar que este partido político también concentró la mayoría en las elecciones de 2022. Esto sería trascendental para el nuevo periodo legislativo, porque hay que tener en cuenta que en mayo se realizará la primera vuelta de comicios presidenciales, en los que Iván Cepeda cuenta con popularidad para liderar la intención al voto . Es importante destacar que una mayoría de izquierda podría significar que las reformas sociales de Petro, como a la salud o las nuevas tributarias, vuelvan a estar en la palestra. Aunque si bien la reforma laboral se logró aprobar, la pensional sigue en un limbo jurídico, por presuntos vicios en la votación en la Cámara de Representantes, mientras que la reforma a la salud tuvo dos oportunidades que fueron frenadas en la Comisión Séptima del Senado. Pese a estos resultados preliminares que arrojó la encuesta en caso de que las votaciones fueran en estos momentos , tampoco hay que dejar de lado la relevancia que siempre han tenido partidos de centro derecha. De hecho, el sondeo reveló que el partido Centro Democrático volvería a cobrar relevancia dentro de los curules con una participación de 15%. La composición por partidos políticos restante quedaría de la siguiente manera: Partido Liberal obtendría 7% de los escaños, Cambio Radical se quedaría con 4%, el Partido Conservador con 2% y los partidos que lograrían 1% de participación son: Independiente, Mira, Alianza Verde y Salvación Nacional. Uno de los casos más relevantes sería el de Alianza Verde, pues en estos momentos cuenta con una participación en el Congreso de 11,52% y pasaría a tener solo 0,3%. Esta previsión coincide con la opinión del exministro de Hacienda y rector de la Universidad EIA, José Manuel Restrepo, quien con seguridad también prevé una disminución en la participación del partido, pues perderá la fuerza que tenía en el...",

  "title": "Estas son las normas laborales que debe conocer para contratar un trabajador doméstico",
  "text": "Con los cambios que trae este año, tanto empleadores como trabajadores deben actualizarse sobre lo que implica una relación laboral formal con un o una empleada doméstica . Es decir, deberán fijarse desde cuánto se debe pagar , hasta cómo se deben manejar los aportes a pensión y las prestaciones sociales. Con el aumento del salario mínimo, todos los valores que dependen de este indicador se ajustan de igual manera. Esto quiere decir que el trabajador doméstico vería un aumento en su ingreso y por lo tanto el empleador debería tenerlo en cuenta desde el momento de la contratación. Laura Galeano, asociada del área laboral de PPU, indicó que el pago del salario mínimo para el personal de trabajo doméstico aplica en iguales condiciones que para otros trabajadores. Ahora, en caso de tratarse de labores por días, el salario a pagar puede ser calculado de manera proporcional a los días trabajados incluyendo la proporción aplicable al día de descanso obligatorio semanal. “En ningún caso el valor remunerado puede ser menor al valor proporcional que corresponda del salario mínimo”, explicó. “Aún cuando el pago se acuerde por días, no exime del reconocimiento proporcional de prestaciones sociales ni de la afiliación y aportes a seguridad social”. “Los trabajadores y las trabajadoras del servicio doméstico deben ser vinculados mediante contrato de trabajo escrito, esto al margen de la jornada pactada”. Para este tipo de trabajo también entra en juego la reforma laboral que fue aprobada el año pasado. En el artículo 33 de esta ley se contempló que los trabajadores y las trabajadoras del servicio doméstico deben ser vinculados mediante contrato de trabajo escrito, esto al margen de la jornada pactada. “En cumplimiento del Convenio 189 de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo, OIT, los trabajadores y las trabajadoras del servicio doméstico deben ser vinculadas mediante contrato de trabajo escrito, en cualquiera de sus modalidades respetando las garantías y los derechos a los que haya lugar, de conformidad con las normas laborales existentes y registrada en la Planilla Integrada de Liquidación de Aportes, Pila, así como las novedades relativas a trabajo suplementario”, se lee en artículo. Juan Felipe Mesias, Abogado Derecho Laboral y Seguridad Social en Scola Abogados, señaló que cuando el pago está acordado por días, esto no exime del reconocimiento proporcional de prestaciones sociales ni de afiliación y aportes a seguridad social. Hay ciertos casos en los que no es obligatorio pagar el auxilio de transporte. De acuerdo con Sebastián Triviño, asociado del área laboral de PPU, los únicos casos en los que el pago del auxilio de transporte no es obligatorio es cuando el empleador suministra el transporte; o cuando el trabajador resida en las instalaciones del empleador, como sería el caso de los empleados de trabajo doméstico internos, o cuando el traslado al lugar de trabajo no le implica ningún costo ni mayor esfuerzo; o cuando no haya prestación del servicio, como lo son las vacaciones, licencias, incapacidades y otras ausencias; o cuando el trabajador devengue más de dos salario...",

  "title": "Año de mundial y mucho fútbol",
  "text": "2026, año de mundial; de dos torneos al año en Sudamérica, de Copa Libertadores y Champions. De mucho, muchísimo fútbol. Parecería que este deporte goza de la mejor salud, al menos desde el punto de vista financiero. Las televisiones pagan lo que pidan los campeonatos o sus organizadores, se cambian los operadores, unos desaparecen, surgen otros y el dinero brota a manos llenas. Torneos o más bien finales en lugares fuera del territorio como la pasada Supercopa española pagada con petrodólares. Salarios desmesurados alejados de la realidad de cualquier país con jugadores menores de 20 años que reciben en una sola quincena lo que la mayoría de trabajadores no recibirá en toda su vida. Eso no está mal, ellos venden espectáculo, que es pagado por los operadores. En general un jugador de fútbol gana mucho, eso no tiene nada de malo. La otra cara de la moneda tiene que ver con la precarización laboral del jugador. No hablo de las grandes estrellas de los equipos europeos que juegan Champions o de algunos cracks en otros países sino del jugador medio que vive de pegarle patadas a un balón que aparentemente tiene protección jurídica de los reglamentos FIFA pues es el ingrediente principal de todo este espectáculo. La protección del contrato de trabajo por parte de la ley o los reglamentos es ficticia. Empezando por la firma misma del contrato, ya no se negocia, de pronto se negocia el salario y remuneraciones adicionales, el resto es un formato en el que nada pueden opinar los jugadores o sus agentes. Los reglamentos de FIFA no se respetan, ni por los clubes ni por las federaciones que no acatan las directrices para sus reglamentos locales. FIFA permanentemente agrega normas que, repito, son ignoradas por federaciones y clubes. Lo mismo ocurre con la ley. Pongamos un ejemplo: la reforma laboral que entró en vigor el año pasado prohibió las cláusulas de rescisión; en nuestro desmadejado fútbol los clubes siguen incluyéndolas en sus contratos con cifras absurdas. Nadie hace nada. Las medidas de fuerza del Ministerio de Trabajo o del Deporte sirven apenas. Al momento de escribir esta columna el Pereira estaba en el calendario del torneo sin mayores problemas a pesar de los líos que apenas hace tres meses tenía. No conozco la situación pero podría asegurar que la mayoría de los jugadores a los que se les debía dinero acabaron terminando el contrato de trabajo por mutuo acuerdo y negociaron la salida con una cifra inferior a la deuda y con la incertidumbre del pago de ese acuerdo. La tendencia empieza a ser contratos de trabajo cortos, de apenas un semestre o contratos largos que son terminados por mutuo acuerdo prácticamente el primer semestre. En Colombia hay equipos que cambian más de seis jugadores por torneo con la ilusión de hacer caja con alguno o de formar un equipo competitivo, ya sabemos que para ganar una estrella se necesita pasar a los cuadrangulares y allí ganar tres partidos. No se necesitan procesos largos...",

  "title": "La paradoja de la “AI Frenzy”",
  "text": "En su edición del 8 de enero, la revista [GI1] The Economist utiliza el término “AI Frenzy” para referirse a la crisis por la que atraviesa la industria electrónica como consecuencia de la euforia desbordada en la adopción de tecnologías de inteligencia artificial. Esta fiebre, por la IA, ha provocado distorsiones en el mercado y un desequilibrio dramático entre la oferta y la demanda de chips para dispositivos inteligentes. El artículo, titulado” The AI frenzy is creating a big problem for consumer electronics” relata cómo tras el entusiasmo que se vivió en el Consumer Electronics Show de Las Vegas, en donde los fabricantes de tecnología exhibieron dispositivos, cada vez más sofisticados, impulsados por modelos de IA que prometen transformar desde los teléfonos inteligentes hasta los automóviles—se esconde una preocupación creciente: la posible escasez mundial de chips tecnológicos. La alta demanda de chips de memoria HBM, una variable de memoria DRAM, con mayor ancho de banda que es la que se utiliza en procesadores de IA y que requiere de una gran cantidad de insumos para su fabricación, ha causado una escasez sin precedentes y un aumento de los precios de los chips que se utilizan en teléfonos, computadores y vehículos. Lo anterior ha provocado “el mayor desajuste entre oferta y demanda” de esos chips que haya registrado el sector Esta dinámica, ha convertido a la inteligencia artificial en un factor de reorganización de la economía, con efectos que desbordan el ámbito tecnológico y que comienzan a sentirse en precios, disponibilidad de insumos clave en diversos sectores de la actividad económica. También resalta el artículo que el mercado de memoria DRAM está excesivamente concentrado, hasta el punto de que, tres empresas, Sk Hynix, Samsung y Micron, que representan más del 90% de los ingresos globales DRAM, han tenido que redirigir su producción preferencialmente hacia las memorias HBM, segmento que tiene márgenes operativas muy superiores, lo que ha ocasionado que el precio de las otras memorias estándar se haya disparado. Se calcula que el precio de los PCs podría aumentar entre 15% y 20% debido a la crisis. Los chips de memoria más elementales, que pueden representar hasta el 40% del costo de smartphones y PCs, son cada vez más costosos y escasos. Por ejemplo, el precio de la DRAM que requieren estos dispositivos se ha multiplicado en 1.360% desde abril de 2025 (The Economist). Según Reuters gigantes tecnológicos como Microsoft, Google, ByteDance y OpenAI están asegurando contratos de largo plazo con los grandes productores de memoria, y están dispuestas a aceptar precios elevados con tal de garantizar abastecimiento. Es posible que algunos fabricantes de smartphones y PCs retrasen sus inversiones en infraestructura digital por cientos de miles de millones de dólares, lo que podría ralentizar la productividad asociada a la IA y añadir nuevas presiones inflacionarias a las causadas por los aranceles y los ajustes monetarios. La crisis en la cadena de suministro de tecnología hará su expansión más desigual y profundizará la brecha digital, lo que afectará particularmente a los...",

  "text": "RED WINGS 4, SENATORS 3 (OT) The Ottawa Senators had a new face in the net with James Reimer making his debut on Sunday night. Unfortunately, it ended with the same old result. The Senators let a pivotal point slip away after former Ottawa winger Alex DeBrincat fired home the winner to secure a 4-3 overtime decision for the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena. Sure, the Senators were able to get a point thanks to 30 stops from Reimer, along with goals from Shane Pinto, Dylan Cozens and Drake Batherson, but Ottawa needs victories badly to have any hope of making the playoffs.

Please try again Interested in more newsletters? “We’ve gotten points in four of our last four games and we’ve played some good hockey,” Batherson said. “It was a bit of a dagger in the last four minutes (on Saturday) night, and considering the back-to-back today’s game was pretty solid.” The frustration boiled over after the club squandered a two-goal lead with four minutes to go and dropped a 6-5 decision to the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night at home. The finger was pointed at goalie Leevi Merilainen after the collapse, which is why the Senators turned to Reimer in this one. This was the club’s second game in less than 24 hours and they were able to push it to OT. This was Reimer’s first start in the National Hockey League since a 5-4 win over the Philadelphia Flyers on April 17, 2025. Signed as an unrestricted free agent last Monday, Reimer, 37, suited up last Sunday for the club’s American Hockey League affiliate in Belleville. This was the first time Merilainen hadn’t played since Dec. 27. Reimer was brought in to stabilize the net. The Senators came into this game with an .868 save percentage, which is last in the NHL. Reimer looked good. He couldn’t stop them all, but kept his club in the game. “He looks poised out there. He’s made some big saves, and he’s kept us in this game,” Pinto told TSN’s Gord Miller after the second. That’s all the Senators need from their goaltenders, and there have been far too many nights when that hasn’t been the case. Reimer got beaten on the glove side by DeBrincat on the first shot he faced in overtime. “It’s fun to play. It’s the greatest game on Earth, right? So, it was good to be back in there,” said Reimer. “I felt pretty good. I felt like I was getting my reads and seeing the puck back there pretty well. “The result isn’t what we want.

The 37-year-old newcomer is expected to be between the pipes for the Senators (22-19-6) when they roll into Motown for a visit with the Detroit Red Wings (29-16-4) on Sunday (5 p.m. ET; TSN5, RDS2). Reimer backed up on Saturday for Leevi Merilainen, who made just 13 saves in a 6-5 overtime loss against the Montreal Canadiens at Canadian Tire Centre. Merilainen’s season save percentage fell to .860, second-last in the NHL among goaltenders with 10 or more starts. “It’s hard to give him a pass,” coach Travis Green said of Merilainen’s performance. “Six goals on (19) shots.

When asked post-game, Green would not commit to Reimer starting on Sunday, but Merilainen’s poor play undoubtedly makes it an easy decision. The Senators cannot afford to have the 23-year-old in net anymore, as they sit seven points outside of the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Straight into the line of fire It has been a whirlwind week and a half for Reimer. On Jan. 9, he signed a professional tryout with Ottawa’s American Hockey League affiliate, the Belleville Senators. Two days later, he made 22 saves in . Despite the .786 save percentage, Belleville interim coach Andrew Campbell believed Reimer held down the fort well. “I mean, it’s a chaotic game,” Campbell said. “The American league is the American league; the NHL is the NHL. And guys are in the American league for a reason. It’s a lot more predictable hockey that he’s used to in the NHL, but yeah, he was solid and it was good for him to see some pucks and get his feet under himself.” That performance was good enough for the NHL club on Monday to sign Reimer to a one-year contract worth a pro-rated $850,000 U.S. He took part in four practices during the week, and also backed up Merilainen against the New York Rangers on Wednesday, an 8-4 drubbing in Ottawa’s favour. Outside of his lone game with the Sens’ farm team, Reimer hasn’t seen a ton of game action this season. He made two starts for Team Canada at the Spengler Cup, in which he had a 1-1-0 record and a .906 save percentage. When he wasn’t overseas representing his country, Reimer was back home in the Okanagan region of B.C., practising with two junior teams in the BCHL. He attended Toronto Maple Leafs training camp in the fall but was never offered a contract. His most recent NHL start was on April 17,...",

Forwards Tim Stutzle: A After a couple of pensive first shifts, Stutzle was pickpocketed and muscled off the puck by Jake Evans immediately before the would-be 2-0 goal. However, he was saved by video review showing the Habs being offside on the play. Stutzle locked in after that, scoring one of his best goals ever, going between the legs and roofing it on Sam Montembault in tight for the 3-2 goal, and later setting up Dylan Cozens in the slot for the 3-3 marker.

Tkachuk was clutch when Ottawa needed a goal, wiring a shot short side on Montembault for the 2-1 goal. His emphatic celebration was telling of what he thought of the “home” crowd, which looked like 80 per cent Habs fans. Tkachuk had a good backcheck on a Ivan Demidov chance, and threw the body around, ending with several hits. One blemish on the night came when he couldn’t keep his cool after being punched by Phillip Danault, retaliating with a jab of his own to throw away a potential 5-on-3 power play. Fabian Zetterlund: B Nothing on the scoresheet, but Zetterlund was good on the cycle and sturdy down low. Dylan Cozens: B+ He threw a massive hit late in the first period and drew a tripping penalty while driving the net in the dying seconds of the frame. The Senators would score on the ensuing power play in the second, and later in the period Cozens took a centering pass from Stutzle and buried a wrist shot blocker side on Montembault on the power play for the tying goal. David Perron: A When Ottawa was its sleepiest in the first, Perron had a massive shift to wake them up, winning battles on the wall and helping hem Montreal in its own zone for a good 40 seconds. He was rewarded for his efforts with a fluky goal when Artem Zub’s point shot deflected in off his skate for the go-ahead goal late in the middle frame.

Khater then retained a lawyer and sought disturbance damages under Ontario’s Expropriation Act, as well as a team of experts to analyze and prepare claims to the city.

In July 2024, Khater and the city agreed in December 2023 on a settlement of $50,000 plus costs prior to an Ontario Land Tribunal hearing scheduled for six days later. Khater’s lawyer claimed $401,387.18 plus interest in legal, appraisal and other costs, but the city’s legal counsel provided an alternative partial-indemnity calculation of $72,448.96 in costs. Partial indemnity is a legal term that means the losing party only pays a portion of the winning party’s legal costs. The city then brought a costs motion to the Ontario Land Tribunal, arguing that Khater acted unreasonably and his experts relied on flawed assumptions, which made the damages claim weak. The city asked the tribunal to reduce the price tag or allow the city to recover its own costs because Khater would have lost on damages claims if the matter was heard by the Ontario Land Tribunal. But in a decision published in October 2025, Ontario Land Tribunal vice-chair William Middleton rejected the city’s attempt to use partial indemnity to dramatically reduce what it agreed to pay after settling. He also said the tribunal could not decide what House of Pizza’s damages were, or if Khater’s claims and expert evidence were strong or weak, as part of this motion because a hearing never happened. The city’s request would be procedurally unfair and legally unfair because it would require the tribunal to decide on compensation without a hearing, Middleton wrote. Once a settlement has been reached, the tribunal can only rule on costs incurred from that settlement. Middleton also said Khater’s conduct...",

  "title": "Former Senators defenceman Steve Duchesne looks back at his time in Ottawa with fond memories",
  "text": "Saturday night was a homecoming for Steve Duchesne. The former Ottawa Senators alternate captain had many memorable nights on the stage he returned to when he was part of the ceremonial faceoff to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Canadian Tire Centre before the club faced the Montreal Canadiens. Duchesne, 60, was brought back to mark the moment, not only because he scored the first goal for the franchise in the building during a 7-3 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on Jan. 19, 1996, but he was a good choice by making an impact in his 140 games with the Senators. The initial goal by Duchesne was scored at 5:55 of the first period, with Alexei Yashin and Daniel Alfredsson drawing the assists. Duchesne was invited to ring the bell during the 2025 playoff series against Montreal in the spring, but was unable to attend because his mother-in-law was ill.

Please try again Interested in more newsletters? “I’m really excited. They called me a few weeks before Christmas to do this, and of course I was happy to do this,” Duchesne told Postmedia from his home in Dallas on Friday. “I didn’t even know I scored the first goal. It must have been an unbelievable end-to-end goal.” Of course, that last comment was tongue-in-cheek because Duchesne has no recollection of that goal. But he never will forget his goal to break a 0-0 tie with a shot from the point at 15:59 of the third period on April 12, 1997, against the Buffalo Sabres to secure the franchise’s first trip to the post-season. “I remember it vividly, Yashin making the pass and right away, without even stopping, shooting the puck and scoring against Dominik Hasek,” Duchesne said. “It was funny because I played with Hasek a few years later, when we won the Cup together in Detroit (in 2002), and I asked him, ‘Do you remember how bad I beat you?’ “Dom told me he was really pissed off. That was a great goal. I had never won the Cup at that point, and that felt good to help get the team to the playoffs. The year was such a struggle because we were up and down. That’s a fond memory. I remember how happy we were.” That wouldn’t have been possible if Wade Redden hadn’t scored the winner the night before in Detroit to keep the Senators’ playoff hopes alive. It was coach Jacques Martin’s first full season behind the bench after he took over on Jan. 24, 1996, only a week after The Palladium, as it was known then, opened. The roster included captain Randy Cunneyworth, along with Radek Bonk, Alexandre...",

  "text": "Canadiens 6, Senators 5 (OT) The Ottawa Senators were angry and frustrated. After blowing a two-goal lead late in the third period and dropping a 6-5 decision to the arch-rival Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night at the Canadian Tire Centre, the Senators didn’t mince words when it came to trying to explain the loss. Goaltender Leevi Merilainen, who has struggled all season, wasn’t good enough as Cole Caufield capped the comeback with the winner only 33 seconds into overtime. Juraj Slavkovsky and Alexandra Carrier set up the heroics by beating Merilainen in a span of 65 seconds to tie it up 5-5. “I think Leevi made some good saves. But I think, at the end of the day, you’ve got to make more than 10 saves to win a game,” said a frustrated Jake Sanderson, who had a four-point effort.

Merilainen gave up six goals on 19 shots. “It’s hard to give him a pass. Six goals on (19) shots, and I’m sure he’d like to have one or two back. I feel bad for him,” said coach Travis Green. Sanderson, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, Brady Tkachuk and Dylan Cozens scored for the Senators, who looked like they were well in control until the Habs got up off the mat. Sanderson extended the Senators’ lead to 5-3 at 7:36 of the third period by firing a bullet by Canadiens netminder Samuel Montembeault. The Senators were six points back of the Boston Bruins for the final wildcard spot in the National Hockey League’s Eastern Conference as they prepared to head into back-to-back contests against the Habs on Saturday and the Red Wings in Detroit on Sunday night. If the Senators are going to make the playoffs for the second straight spring, the only option down the stretch is to play better than .600 in the final 36 games of the regular season. “It’s a massive game. We know that it’s going to take all of us to get the job (done),” Tkachuk said before the game. “Expect it to be a highly intense, highly emotional game. Two teams that both need a win, and, of course, these games are always fun to play in.” The Senators battled back to take a 4-3 lead through two periods. Perron gave Ottawa its first lead with 1:36 left in the second period, after Cozens tied it up by beating Montembeault on a power play at 15:31. Merilainen made his 10th consecutive start and 11th straight appearance in the net for Ottawa. The Senators battled back from being 2-0 early in the second period, but Merilainen allowed Josh Anderson to restore...",

In explaining how Ottawa leapt ahead of such perennially favourite safe Sunday-drive destinations as Istanbul and Mexico City, the study — did I mention I made it up? — concluded that Ottawa’s Municipal Traffic Safety Index Factor, or MTSIF, “increased significantly after the ability to measure danger was removed,” a standard methodological technique known as reducing noise in the data. This is just the first of a handful of bogus studies I intend to fabricate after reading that Mayor Mark Sutcliffe last weekend promoted on X an almost equally well-founded “study” that touted Ottawa as the most liveable city in North America.

Credit to that the mayor, a former journalist, should have done. The outlet reported that the quality-of-life ranking cited by Sutcliffe originated with CIC News, a website that calls itself “The voice of Canadian immigration.” The data cited in the ranking, meanwhile, is from Numbeo, a Serbia-based website that relies largely on user-generated data and openly acknowledges that it does not verify its accuracy. A brief visit to Numbeo’s site shows that the Ottawa “data” Sutcliffe was boasting about appears to be drawn from the opinions of a few hundred users, supplemented by publicly available fare information from OC Transpo and — this part I swear I’m not making up — movie listings from Landmark Cinemas’ Orléans location. It’s almost as if someone in Belgrade wanted to see The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants and was trying to figure out how to get to the theatre. The Numbeo site, meanwhile, includes this disclaimer: “There is absolutely no assurance that any statement on the website is correct or precise.” Somewhere between an apartment building in Belgrade and the mayor’s office in Ottawa, information that should have been taken with a grain of salt was elevated to a wholly undeserved status. It’s possible the mayor didn’t take the “study” seriously, but shared it anyway because it made the city look good. And, besides, who was going to check?

  "text": "There was a familiar face on the ice with the Ottawa Senators on Friday. Goaltender Linus Ullmark, who hasn’t skated with the team in 19 days after taking a leave of absence for personal reasons, resumed skating with the Senators at the Bell Sensplex. He won’t suit up against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday at the Canadian Tire Centre or the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday on the road and there is no timetable for Ullmark’s return, but this has to be viewed as a positive sign for the club’s top goalie. “I’m happy he’s back skating with the group,” coach Travis Green said. “He looks good, and it’s just a positive.” Is there a timeline for his return? “No,” Green said. “We’re all just in agreement that we’re taking it day-by-day.” Ullmark in action. The expectation is Ullmark, who has been skating on his own for the past 10 days, will accompany the Senators on a three-game trip that begins in Detroit before making stops in Columbus on Tuesday and Nashville on Thursday.

Ullmark shared a net with veteran goaltender James Reimer, who is expected to make his debut against the Wings on Sunday. as an unrestricted free agent after a brief tryout in the AHL with Belleville. Goaltender Leevi Merilainen, who has carried the ball in Ullmark’s absence, is expected to make his 10th consecutive start and 11th straight appearance against the Habs. We really don’t know when Ullmark will make his first appearance in the club’s lineup since he was pulled against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Dec. 27, but his teammates are confident he’s making progress. “It’s great seeing him back on the ice,” alternate captain Thomas Chabot said of Ullmark’s return. “He’s been skating a little bit, but just to be back with the team is a big step in the right direction. We’re happy to have him back. “Anytime you’re out or injured, or anytime you get back with the team and back to skating that makes you feel even better. It’s a step forward towards to playing another game. Just to see him and have him around again has been great.” Once Ullmark does return, Steve Staios — the club’s president of hockey operations and general manager — will have a decision to make on how the organization is going to use its goaltenders. Merilainen stated on Friday that he hasn’t been told anything about what route the club will take once Ullmark is ready to play, which could be either Thursday in Nashville or in one of the club’s back-to-back games next Saturday and Sunday at the Canadian...",

  "title": "Kr lin using Medvedchuk interview to justify Russia's rejection of peace efforts – ISW",
  "text": "Russian state media have circulated statements by former Ukrainian lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk, who is linked to the Kremlin, in order to prepare the Russian public for the Kremlin's rejection of peace in the near future amid ongoing negotiations between the United States, Ukraine, and Europe. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said this in a new report seen by Ukrinform. ISW analysts drew attention to an interview Medvedchuk gave to the Kremlin news agency TASS on January 18, in which he claimed that \"there will be no peace in Ukraine in 2026.\" Medvedchuk also reiterated claims that \"time is on the Kremlin's side\" and emphasized the Kremlin's commitment to achieving its original war aims without negotiating with Ukraine. Medvedchuk also reiterated the Kremlin's longstanding rhetoric falsely framing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war against the West, claiming that the Ukrainian government is illegitimate, and rejecting Ukrainian elections (which the Kremlin itself has demanded to secure a peace deal) on anything but Russia's terms, the report said. Read also: EU prolongs sanctions against Russian propagandists, including Medvedchuk and allies, by another year ISW stressed that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials have repeatedly used these rhetorical lines to emphasize Russia's commitment to its original war aims and its theory of victory that maintains that the Russian military and economy can outlast Ukraine and Western support for Ukraine – a theory the West can help disprove with support to Ukraine, the experts said. Analysts believe the Kremlin uses Medvedchuk to make more extreme statements than Putin and Kremlin officials themselves make \"through a voice claiming to represent Ukraine.\" \"The Kremlin is likely using Medvedchuk's January 18 interview to justify Russia's rejection of peace efforts to resolve its war in Ukraine,\" ISW experts said. They noted that Medvedchuk's statements come against the backdrop of ongoing U.S.-European Union-Ukraine peace talks to develop a peace plan and the most recent round of Ukraine-U.S. talks in Miami on January 16. \"ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin likely intends to reject outright any peace proposal that does not acquiesce to Russia's full demands, including terms that result from the recent negotiations,\" the report said.

Nonetheless, flown by the US Space Force, missions last hundreds of days, yet the public knows next to nothing other than when the space vehicle launches and lands. Otherwise, all information is withheld. Officially, the X-37B is not a weapon, but merely a platform designed to test, observe, and signal. We don’t know exactly what the X-37B is. What we do know is that the mysterious space plane is an uncrewed , reusable orbital spaceplane. Originally developed by NASA, it was transferred to DARPA and then the US Air Force, and most recently, the US Space Force, who operates the program today. The X-37B is launched atop the Atlas V or Falcon 9 rocket and lands autonomously on conventional runways. What happens in between is unclear.

Presumably, the X-37B bridges a gap between satellites and spacecraft, designed to stay in orbit for years before returning to Earth. The X-37B measures 29 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet. Weighing 11,000 pounds, the X-37B has a 7 foot long payload bay, though the exact payload capabilities remain classified. The spacecraft is powered by a conventional launch vehicle and depends on a deployable solar array for on-orbit power. An advanced reusable heat shield is used for thermal protection. The guidance and landing systems are autonomous. The program’s secrecy is designed to protect the payload, mission profiles, and capabilities. Likely roles include sensor testing, materials experiments, and satellite technology validation. The X-37B likely has the ability to change orbit and return hardware. The platform is inherently sensitive; disclosure would help adversaries and enable countermeasures. Ambiguity itself is strategic because rivals must now assume the X-37B is capable of multiple mission types, even if none are offensive .

  "title": "J-20S: China’s ‘Mighty Dragon’ Fighter Might Be An Aircraft Carrier Killer Horror Show",
  "text": "Chinese military expert Zhang Xuefeng in a recent interview revealed a cornucopia of details about the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter . Speaking to China Central Television (CCTV) on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the J -20’s first official flight in January 2011 , Zhang discussed the plans for a comprehensive upgrade of the platform. Chinese officials also released a new video of the flight from 15 years ago . But Zhang spoke about plans to design the J-20 to be capable of carrying out a new mission . The plans involve the two-seat version of the aircraft, the J-20S. (The “S” added to a Chinese fighter-aircraft designator is commonly used to denote a second-cockpit model.) The J-20S design makes this the world’s first twin-seat stealth fighter. It retains medium- and long-range air superiority mission capabilities, as well as being used for precision strike missions against ground and maritime targets. It demonstrates prominent situational awareness, electronic jamming, and tactical command-and-control capabilities. The CCTV broadcast stated that the J-20S is also capable of acting as a forward tactical airborne command post . In this role, the aircraft directs a group of other platforms and plays a role similar to that of a quarterback. The pilot is able to carry out mission objectives on his own but can also hand off specific missions to other platforms, Zhang explained. The rear-seat pilot or weapon system officer is there to handle some of the workload as well, controlling and coordinating with drones . This separation of mission functions maximizes the effectiveness of the entire combat system, said Zhang. Reducing the load on the pilot makes the aircraft more than just a multirole fighter . The J-20S is officially the third version of the Chengdu fighter . Previous variants include the original J-20 that first flew in 2011, and the J-20A, which featured a new engine and new avionics. The J-20A began production in July 2020, with its original Russian AL-31FN engine replaced by an advanced Chinese-designed WS-10C in late 2019. That aircraft was first seen at Air Show China 2021 , at Zhuhai in Guangdong Province. J-20 Fighter. Image Credit: Creative Commons. J-20 Fighter from China. Image Credit: Creative Commons. J-20 Fighter. Image Credit: Chinese CCTV. Based on a People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) promotional recruitment video from January 2021, it appeared the J-20A variant flying with WS10C engines had already entered service with the 172nd Air Brigade at the Flight Test and Training Base at Cangzhou-Cangxian, in Hebei Province. This base is part of the PLA’s Central Theater Command, but at the time it was not possible to discern how many of these upgraded aircraft had been transferred to the unit. That brigade was also the first to receive the initial J-20 versions in 2017. This unit is responsible for training instructors and developing a training program for any new aircraft achieving initial operating capability with the PLAAF. The J-20S is optimized for several mission profiles, but some are currently performed...",

  "title": "JAS 39 Gripen Has a Message for Canada and the F-35",
  "text": "As the Canadian government grapples with a decision over the future of its fighter jet fleet, a key promise made by Saab that was designed to encourage Ottawa to choose its Gripen platform over Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II appears to come with a catch: the Canadian Armed Forces would need to buy 72 JAS 39 Gripen jets and six GlobalEye surveillance aircraft for its promise of creating Canadian jobs to be realized. The news was reported by CBC News in recent days, confirming that Saab is seeking Ottawa’s approval to replace all 72 remaining jets originally part of an 88-strong F-35 fleet with its own platforms . Industry and government sources have confirmed that the Swedish aircraft manufacturer’s proposals for both aircraft are currently being considered by defense experts. The review not only focuses on the technical capabilities of the JAS 39 Gripen platform , which is by all measures inferior to the United States’ F-35, but also on the economic benefits that would come with choosing the European platform. Saab says it can deliver 12,600 jobs in Canada if the deal is accepted – an increase over the roughly 10,000 jobs that were promised by Saab officials last year. JAS 39 Gripen. Image Credit: Creative Commons. JAS 39 Gripen Fighter. Image Credit: Creative Commons. Saab JAS 39 Gripen E. Image from Saab. JAS 39 Gripen. Image Credit: Saab. “The government is interested in all major projects that can not only protect Canada’s security and sovereignty, but also create jobs across the country,” Industry Minister Melanie Joly said to CBC News. “We certainly can’t control President Trump, but…we can control our defence investments, who we award contracts to and how we are ultimately able to create jobs in Canada. So we’re going to focus on that.” The comment seems to indicate that the Canadian government, which has yet to release the results of an internal review into its original plan to purchase a full fleet of 88 F-35s, is seriously considering Saab’s offering. Saab’s proposal, should it be accepted, would represent a fundamental shift in Canada’s long-term airpower and industrial strategy – and not necessarily for the better. This would not be a partial readjustment to its existing fighter procurement plan, but a total re-imagining of its fighter fleet at a time when these assets are arguably more important than ever . According to the latest reporting from CBC, Saab’s offer is structured around Canada becoming a manufacturing and export hub for both platforms, not just establishing facilities in the country to build or maintain the aircraft Canada purchases. The proposed manufacturing hub would produce aircraft for international customers, and Saab says there is potential export demand for as many as 100 JAS 39 Gripen aircraft for Ukraine and possibly GlobalEye customers in Europe , including France and Germany . Saab has proposed establishing production facilities in Ontario and Quebec, supported by a pan-Canadian supplier network. The GlobalEye aircraft would be built in partnership with Bombardier using the Global...",

  "text": "“I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.”— That quote belongs to Alexander III, better known as Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia or Ancient Greece, and it drives home the importance of proper leadership in determining the effectiveness of a military unit . Alexander the Great Map of Conquest Quote of the Day. Image Credit: Creative Commons. Military leaders would do well to heed Alexander’s words, as he’s considered one of the greatest military commanders in history (ancient and modern alike). Alexander III was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon, circa July 20/21, 356 BC, the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II of the Argead dynasty, and his fourth wife, Olympias (daughter of Neoptolemus I , Aeacid king of Epirus). (Philip II had a total of seven or eight wives , but Olympias had the lofty status of principal wife, thanks in no small part to birthing Alexander). According to urban legend, he was related to the Greek heroes Hercules from his father’s side and Achilles from his mother’s side. Phillip II made sure that his son received the best possible education, hiring no less than the great Greek philosopher Aristotle as a tutor when Alexander was 13 years old. When Alexander was 16, his father left the country to do battle, leaving the teenage son as regent, or temporary ruler of Macedonia. Circa October 25, 336 BC, Philip II was assassinated the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias . Alexander was proclaimed on the spot as his father’s successor to the throne at the age of 20. The state was set for him to embark upon his path of conquest and thus immortalize himself as Alexander the Great. Yes, that’s correct, Alexander the Great never lost a single battle. As noted by his Ducksters mini-bio: “Here is the order of his conquests: -First, he moved through Asia Minor, which is today’s Turkey. -He took over Syria, defeating the Persian Army at Issus and then laying siege to Tyre. -Next, he conquered Egypt and established Alexandria as the capital. -After Egypt came Babylonia and Persia, including the city of Susa. -Then he moved through Persia and began to prepare for a campaign in India.” Incredibly, he had created this massive empire by the time he was a mere 30 years old. But nothing lasts forever, and a mere two years later, circa June 10/11, 323 BC, Alexander the Great died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II , in Babylon (within the present day city of Hillah , Babil Governorate, Iraq; on a night of enjoying fine wine, he suddenly developed a fatal fever. Some historians suspect that he was poisoned, but that remains in dispute to this day. His empire fell apart shortly thereafter, as his generals, called the Diadochi, degenerated into internecine warfare . He certainly wouldn’t qualify for the title of “the Great” if...",

  "text": "Synopsis: The YF-118G was developed in secrecy at Area 51. It used a blended-wing-body shape, shielded intake, and gapless control surfaces to reduce radar signature, while single-piece composite construction minimized seams that reflect radar energy. -To keep costs low, engineers used off-the-shelf parts—landing gear from Beech aircraft, a Pratt & Whitney JT15D engine, a Harrier ejection seat, and mixed cockpit components. -The prototype flew 38 test missions before being revealed publicly in 2002 and later displayed in Dayton. -19FortyFive visited the YF-118G back last summer and took the photos below for your viewing pleasure. The YF-118G “Bird of Prey” was arguably one of the most unique, best-looking aircraft ever built. If you think it resembled a sci-fi spacecraft from Hollywood, you would not be wrong. The aircraft was named after the Klingon Bird of Prey from the Star Trek franchise, due to its outward appearance that mimicked the Star Trek spacecraft. The aircraft minimized radar cross-section with its blended-wing-body configuration, shielded engine intake, and “gapless” control surfaces. YF-118G. Image taken by Harry J. Kazianis for 19FortyFive.

Image taken by Harry J. Kazianis for 19FortyFive. McDonald Douglas’ Phantom Works designed the Bird of Prey, which Boeing built in the 1990s. This aircraft was developed at Area 51. The YF-118G Bird of Prey was designed and built as a highly strategic private-venture technology demonstrator developed by McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) Phantom Works between 1992 and 1999. Its primary purpose was to pioneer rapid, low-cost manufacturing and design techniques for future stealth aircraft, rather than to serve as an operational fighter . It was never intended for operational service, but to test the limits of stealth technology at a low cost. Boeing transitioned from a paper design to building the aircraft using off-the-shelf parts for less than $67 million . That’s less than the cost of a single F-35 stealth fighter. The program was a huge success, and the lessons learned paved the way for future stealth aircraft, such as the X-32, the F-22 , and the F-35, as well as the X-45 unmanned combat drone, which forever changed aircraft design. Why did Boeing fund this project with approximately $67 million of its own money? Boeing wanted to prove that advanced, all-aspect stealth aircraft could be designed and built at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs like the B-2 Spirit . To achieve this, they utilized rapid prototyping. The team used “virtual reality” computer-aided design to speed up development. In an incredible show of resourcefulness and frugality, Boeing saved a boatload of money by building the Bird of Prey out of spare parts. To expedite development and minimize expenses, the aircraft utilized existing, non-specialized components. Examples include the landing gear, which was adapted from a Beech King Air and Queen Air aircraft ; a single commercial Pratt & Whitney JT15D-5C turbofan engine; an...",

  "text": "The Boeing X-32 was an unsuccessful contender in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, featuring several notable design and performance characteristics, particularly a single-piece, large delta wing that offered significant structural efficiency and large internal fuel capacity . Boeing X-32 Stealth Fighter in Maryland. Image taken by 19FortyFive.com staff back in 2025. Its best features were characterized by a focus on simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and, in some respects, superior performance in specific areas compared to its rival, the X-35. During the Department of Defense’s Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program in the 1990s, Boeing and Lockheed Martin presented the X-32 and X-35 concept demonstrators, respectively, for the Air Force to choose a final design. Lockheed won the competition and has now built over 1,200 F-35s, with more still in production today. The F-35 is in use with the US and 20 countries. But what about the Boeing X-32? Boeing built two variants, the X-32A and X-32B, which performed Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL), Short Take-Off and Landing (STOVL), and Carrier Variant operations. But why did the X-32 lose to the F-35? Let’s take a look at Boeing’s prototype for the Joint Strike Fighter Program and examine its best attributes . The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program was the Department of Defense’s (DoD) effort to define affordable, next-generation strike aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marines, and our allies. The DoD created this joint program charter to bring the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps together to reduce the costs of future strike warfare concepts by maturing and transitioning advanced technologies, components, and processes . Boeing X-32 Fighter image taken by 19FortyFive back in July 2025. First flying in September 2000, the X-32 made 66 flights during its four months of testing. These flights demonstrated the aircraft’s handling qualities for in-flight refueling, weapons bay operations, and supersonic flight. The X-32 was crewed by a single pilot and powered by a Pratt & Whitney JSF119-614 afterburning turbofan with approximately 50,000 pounds of thrust, pushing the aircraft to a top speed of Mach 1.6, about 1,200 mph. The aircraft would carry either the 20 mm M61A2 cannon, or the 27 mm Mauser BK-27 cannon , 6 AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, 2 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles, 2 x 2,000 lb (900 kg) class guided bombs, 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) of a full range of external stores, as well as Anti-radiation missiles for enemy suppression missions, Air-to-surface weapons, and Auxiliary fuel tanks We’ll examine some of the X-32’s best attributes. The X-32 was designed with fewer moving parts to lower production, maintenance, and lifecycle costs. The focus of Boeing’s X-32 was on maximizing affordability, manufacturing efficiency, and structural simplicity. Boeing X-32 Fighter image taken by 19FortyFive back in July 2025. The X-32’s design aimed to drastically reduce production and life-cycle costs by minimizing variations across different service variants and reducing the overall number of parts.

  "text": "For decades, the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was a visible symbol of American maritime power – and while for many years it served as an operational flattop, it later became a news story as the Navy grappled with the difficulty of retiring a ship of this size . Mayport, Fla. (Nov. 11, 2003) — USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) departs Naval Station Mayport under her own power following a ten month Extended Service Repair Availability (ESRA). During a short at sea period the ship will test numerous systems installed or upgraded while in port.

Image of several old carriers headed to scrap yard. On January 16, 2025, the decommissioned carrier departed the U.S. Navy’s Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia to be towed to Brownsville, Texas, where it will be dismantled. “The ex-John F. Kennedy (CV 67) began its final journey this morning as it departed from the U.S. Navy’s Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, PA for transit to Brownsville, Texas where it will be dismantled,” a statement from January 16, 2025 reads. The move marked the beginning of the end of the Navy’s last conventionally powered aircraft carrier – a distinction that makes CV-67 particularly notable because every U.S. carrier class that followed it – beginning with nuclear-powered supercarriers – made the shift to reactors rather than relying on fossil-fuel propulsion . After its departure, the carrier entered the Brownsville ship channel on February 2, 2025, completing its final transit and arriving at the dismantlement site operated by International Shipbreaking Ltd. The Navy’s official position on the dismantlement and retirement of the CV-67 is this: the vessel was removed from service years ago and was ultimately slated for dismantlement once museum-ship proposals failed to produce a viable plan. Specifically, that means no city or nonprofit was able to secure the funding, docking location, and long-term maintenance plan required to keep the aircraft carrier as a public museum, leaving dismantlement as the only remaining option . For the ship to be dismantled , it must enter into a long and regulated industrial process that involves cutting the ship down, recycling what materials can be recycled, and disposing of hazardous materials under U.S. environmental and workplace rules. All of that must take place at a site capable of handling a vessel of this size. The Brownsville destination was not incidental: the same contractors and port infrastructure here have been used for other retired carriers,...",

And, as you can expect, 19FortyFive was there just yesterday , taking all of the M1E3 tank photos in this article. In fact, we have posted a large selection just below.

Image Credit: 19FortyFive.com The tank features several departures from previous Abrams models, such as an unmanned turret, a hybrid electric powerplant, and a new autoloader, reducing the crew to three. The tank is expected to be the next-generation tank for the U.S. Army, able to go toe-to-toe with the most advanced tanks America’s adversaries can field. But how well does it hold up against tanks like the T-14 Armata, which many in Russia call the best tank in the world ? In terms of survivability, the M1E3 is expected to include modular armor packages for different mission types, along with both active and passive protection systems, as part of the survival onion of layered defense . The demonstrator shown off in Detroit includes none of these things, though armor will likely be added later in its development . The M1E3 reportedly treats survivability as a combination of not being seen, not being hit, not being penetrated, and fighting through damage, each supported by sensors, decoys, networking, and armor/APS layers. At least, this is how the Army described it in their report to Congress . M1E3 from the Detroit Auto Show. Taken by 19FortyFive.com on 1/17/2026. The T-14 takes on a similar approach to protection via Afganit hard-kill/soft-kill defenses and a crew capsule protected by reactive and composite armor. By removing the crew from the turret and placing ammunition behind armor with blast-mitigation features, a penetration into the turret is less likely to be catastrophic to human life, while active protection intercepts or defeats inbound anti-tank threats . There are questions about the effectiveness of the Afghanit system or the various passive protection elements, but on paper, the T-14 incorporates a number of comprehensive protection measures, making it the most well-protected Russian tank ever built . The M1E3 ditches the traditional gas turbine engine in favor of a hybrid diesel-electric powerplant . This change directly addresses one of Abrams’s enduring drawbacks in expeditionary operations: an insatiable appetite for fuel that complicates operational tempo and logistics . The engine on the new tank is either a C13D or a C18 , which produces about 1000-horsepower. The torsion bar suspension is also being replaced with a new hydro-pneumatic system that will reportedly take up less space...",

  "title": "China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter Is a ‘Flying Horror Show’ for the U.S. Military",
  "text": "Numerous public reports are exploding into publication about China’s ability to quickly mass-produce its J-20 5th-Gen stealth fighter “at scale,” a circumstance some speculate could enable the People’s Liberation Army – Air Force to field a force of more than 1,000 J-20 Mighty Dragons by 2030. J-20 Mighty Dragon Stealth Fighter. Image Credit: Chinese Internet. Chinese J-20 stealth fighter. Image Credit: Chinese Internet. Chinese J-20 Stealth Fighter. Image Credit: Chinese Internet. Image of Chinese J-20 stealth fighter which could be soon armed with laser weapons. This reality raises a seemingly endless series of questions about the PLA’s anticipated ability to “mass” 5th-generation firepower in defense of its perimeter or even in support of offensive operations . Until recently, there have been very few instances wherein the J-20 has been “seen” flying missions, drills, or training . Apart from one or two documented instances, the “airborne” J-20 has been largely absent from public view. Perhaps the PLA wants to “hide” or preserve some of its unique attributes, such as flight vectoring or stealth properties . A group of U.S. scholars catalogued a threefold increase in Chinese aircraft incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone in recent years, as PLA activity around Taiwan has massively intensified, yet noted that the J-20 has indeed been largely “absent” from these incursions . Certainly, the large-scale uptick in violation flights, which jumped from 972 in 2021 to 3,119 in 2022, can be interpreted along the lines of several axes of thought, including war drills and invasion preparation, potential testing of newer technologies, and related Concepts of Operation, and of course, conducting extensive surveillance of Taiwan and US surface and undersea assets. (published by the Routledge Taylor and Francis Group in the Journal of Strategic Studies in June 2023.) China may be largely “hiding” its J-20 from public view or “observation” by the U.S. and allies, but this strategy might also preclude Chinese pilots from “training,” “wargaming,” or actually accumulating critical “flight hours” in the jet in preparation for a mission . Keeping the J-20 largely out of surveillance certainly makes it difficult for rivals such as the U.S., Japan, or Taiwan to monitor it, making it harder for the Pentagon and its allies to “study” and “learn” about the aircraft’s performance parameters. Information about the J-20 is largely available only from what the PLAAF says about itself in government-backed Chinese newspapers. For instance, publications such as the Chinese government-backed Global Times regularly cite the existence of the J-20s upgraded, extremely powerful domestically built WS-15 engine. Beyond this detail and the available “specs” citing the J-20’s speed, altitude, and range, very little technological detail about the J-20 is publicly available. Observers are largely restricted to analyzing its double-wing, elongated fuselage, and visible stealth configurations. Research published by the Pentagon’s China Aerospace Studies Institute, a portion of National Defense University, suggests that perhaps the J-20 is defensively postured to a degree by virtue of being engineered with a larger, longer-range AESA radar designed to protect mainland China...",

  "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING President Donald Trump fired off a new message aimed at Denmark in a late-night social media post as he continued his push to seize control over Greenland . The president wrote on his Truth Social website just after 11 p.m. ET: “NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!! President Donald J. Trump” Trump, who wanted to buy Greenland in his first term, has grown increasingly belligerent on the issue and has even refused to rule out the use of force in taking the island, which is a semi-autonomous Danish territory. PBS News reported on Sunday that Trump sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre saying that since he did not win the Nobel Peace Prize, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.” Trump reportedly wrote:",

  "text": "19/01/2026 19:18 Mai Phương ANTD.VN - Ít nhất 39 người đã thiệt mạng và 24 người khác bị thương nặng sau khi 2 đoàn tàu cao tốc va chạm vào nhau ở miền Nam Tây Ban Nha tối 18-1. Thủ tướng Tây Ban Nha Pedro Sánchez đã gọi sự việc là “một đêm đau thương đối với đất nước chúng ta”. Người bị thương được đưa đi cấp cứu Đoàn tàu cao tốc Iryo khởi hành từ Málaga đến Madrid đã bị trật bánh gần Adamuz, lao sang đường ray ngược chiều và va chạm với một đoàn tàu đang chạy tới, khiến đoàn tàu này cũng bị trật bánh, cơ quan đường sắt Adif của Tây Ban Nha thông báo trên mạng xã hội X. Adif cho biết vụ tai nạn xảy ra khoảng 10 phút sau khi đoàn tàu Iryo rời Málaga hướng đến Madrid lúc 18h40 (theo giờ địa phương) tối 18-1. Đoàn tàu này đã bị trật bánh và đâm vào một tàu đang di chuyển theo chiều từ Madrid tới Huelva, một thành phố khác ở miền Nam Tây Ban Nha. Lực lượng Cảnh sát Quốc gia và lính cứu hỏa tích cực làm việc tại hiện trường để sơ tán tất cả hành khách và đã thành lập một đội ứng phó khẩn cấp chung. 75 người đã được đưa đến bệnh viện, trong đó 24 người bị thương nặng, theo nhà chức trách. Những người bị ảnh hưởng được chuyển tới Trung tâm cộng đồng Caseta Municipal “Có rất nhiều người bị thương - tôi vẫn còn run”, Maria San José, 33 tuổi, một hành khách trên đoàn tàu đầu tiên bị trật bánh, nói với tờ El País. Một hành khách khác trên chuyến tàu thứ hai - di chuyển từ Madrid đến Huelva - cho biết: “Mọi người la hét, hành lý của họ rơi khỏi giá để đồ. Thật may là tôi ngồi ở toa thứ tư - toa cuối cùng”. Đội trưởng đội cứu hỏa Córdoba, Paco Carmona, nói rằng mặc dù hành khách trên tàu Iryo đã được sơ tán trong vòng vài giờ sau tai nạn, nhưng các toa của đoàn tàu thứ hai bị hư hại nặng, với ghế ngồi bị biến dạng. “Vẫn còn người bị mắc kẹt. Chiến dịch đang tập trung vào việc đưa họ ra khỏi những khu vực rất hẹp”, ông nói, “Chúng tôi phải đưa thi thể ra ngoài để tiếp cận những người còn sống. Đây đang là một nhiệm vụ phức tạp”. Bộ trưởng Giao thông vận tải Tây Ban Nha, ông Óscar Puente, cho biết nguyên nhân vụ tai nạn vẫn chưa được xác định. Phát biểu trong cuộc họp báo tại ga Atocha ở Madrid, ông nói thêm rằng thật “kỳ lạ” khi vụ tàu trật bánh lại xảy ra trên một đoạn đường ray thẳng. Ông Puente cho hay, hầu hết những người thiệt mạng và bị thương đều ở trong 2 toa đầu tiên...",

Quá trình xét xử cho thấy, tối 26-7-2025, Tổ công tác Công an xã Hoài Đức, Hà Nội thực hiện nhiệm vụ tuần tra, kiểm soát, phát hiện Giang Văn Dũng có biểu hiện nghi vấn nên tiến hành kiểm tra hành chính. Tại thời điểm kiểm tra, Dũng đang cầm 1 túi nilon chứa chất ma túy trong tay. Do hoảng sợ, bị cáo thả túi ma túy trên xuống đất. Bị cáo Giang Văn Dũng bị đưa ra xét xử tại phiên toà. Tại cơ quan điều tra và tại tòa bị cáo khai nhận, khoảng tháng 4-2025, Dũng nảy sinh ý định kiếm tiền bằng việc mua bán trái phép chất ma túy. Bị cáo sử dụng mạng xã hội Telegram liên hệ với một đối tượng có tên “Bảo Bảo” để mua ma túy tổng hợp. Hai bên thỏa thuận, khi “Bảo Bảo” mang ma túy đến khu vực gần cổng chào xã Đan Phượng, huyện Đan Phượng (cũ), Hà Nội, đối tượng này sẽ ném ma túy ở ven đường Quốc lộ 32 để Giang Văn Dũng đến lấy. Sau đó bị cáo Dũng sẽ để tiền tại một vị trí khác ven đường theo hướng dẫn, rồi thông báo lại cho “Bảo Bảo”. Mỗi lần giao dịch xong, cả hai đều xóa toàn bộ tin nhắn trên Telegram nhằm tránh bị phát hiện. Bị cáo Dũng khai, đã mua của “Bảo Bảo” nhiều loại ma túy tổng hợp gồm ketamine, ma túy đá và thuốc lắc với tổng số tiền khoảng 30 triệu đồng. Sau khi nhận ma túy, bị cáo mang về nhà chia nhỏ thành từng túi nilon nhỏ để cất giấu. Khi đi ra ngoài, Dũng mang theo một phần để bán cho người nghiện ma túy tại khu vực Mỹ Đình và các đối tượng liên hệ qua mạng xã hội. Theo lời khai của bị cáo, đối tượng đã bán ma túy “đá” và ketamine với giá 500.000 đồng/túi, còn ma túy “kẹo” thì bán lẻ theo yêu cầu của khách. Khoảng 20h30 phút ngày 26-7-2025, khi bị cáo mang theo ma túy trên người và để trên ô tô, chuẩn bị bán cho khách thì bị lực lượng công an phát hiện, bắt giữ. Kết quả xét nghiệm cho thấy Giang Văn Dũng dương tính với ma túy.

  "text": "19/01/2026 18:06 Lê Vinh ANTD.VN - Trước giờ bóng lăn trận bán kết U23 châu Á 2026, HLV Antonio Puche bên phía U23 Trung Quốc bày tỏ sự thận trọng khi đánh giá về đối thủ U23 Việt Nam. Theo ông, đội bóng áo đỏ đang nắm lợi thế nhất định về lịch thi đấu, khi có thêm một ngày nghỉ để hồi phục thể lực so với U23 Trung Quốc. Nhà cầm quân người Tây Ban Nha thừa nhận yếu tố này có thể tạo ra khác biệt nhất định trong một trận đấu căng thẳng ở vòng knock-out. Tuy nhiên, ông cho rằng đó cũng là đặc thù quen thuộc của các giải đấu lớn và U23 Trung Quốc buộc phải thích nghi. Ông nhấn mạnh các học trò đã nỗ lực qua từng trận đấu và việc góp mặt ở bán kết đã là một cột mốc đáng nhớ, nhưng tham vọng của U23 Trung Quốc không dừng lại ở đó. HLV U23 Trung Quốc - Antonio Puche (bìa phải) \"U23 Việt Nam có lợi thế hơn U23 Trung Quốc về 1 ngày nghỉ. Họ sẽ hồi phục tốt hơn so với chúng tôi. Dẫu sao, U23 Trung Quốc vẫn phải thích nghi vì đó là đặc thù lịch thi đấu. Chúng tôi đã cố gắng từng trận. Giấc mơ cũng đã thành hiện thực khi đội vào bán kết. Nhưng U23 Trung Quốc không dừng lại. Đội muốn hướng tới chung kết\", HLV Antonio Puche nói. Nhắc lại những lần đối đầu trong năm trước, HLV Antonio Puche đánh giá cao lối chơi của U23 Việt Nam. Theo ông, đội bóng của HLV Kim Sang-sik sở hữu tổ chức chiến thuật chặt chẽ, khả năng chuyển đổi trạng thái nhanh và kỷ luật trong từng pha bóng. Chính vì thế, U23 Trung Quốc sẽ không dễ dàng triển khai tấn công, đồng thời cũng phải duy trì sự tập trung tối đa khi U23 Việt Nam tổ chức phản công hoặc gia tăng sức ép. Vị HLV này cho rằng trận bán kết sẽ đòi hỏi U23 Trung Quốc phải làm việc với cường độ cao, từ khâu tổ chức lối chơi đến sự tập trung của từng cá nhân. Theo ông, đây là cuộc đấu mà chỉ một khoảnh khắc thiếu tập trung cũng có thể khiến cục diện thay đổi. Trận bán kết giữa U23 Việt Nam và U23 Trung Quốc sẽ diễn ra lúc 22h30 ngày 20-1 theo giờ Việt Nam. Ở bên kia chiến tuyến, thầy trò HLV Kim Sang-sik bước vào trận đấu với khát vọng tiếp tục nối dài hành trình ấn tượng tại giải đấu, mang theo tinh thần quả cảm, sự chuẩn bị kỹ lưỡng và niềm tin vững chắc vào sức mạnh tập thể để hướng tới cột mốc lịch sử mới tại sân chơi châu lục.

  "title": "Authenticator Apps vs SMS Codes – Which 2FA Method Holds Up Better",
  "text": "Two-factor authentication exists to make a stolen password less useful. Attackers noticed long ago that breaking into accounts by guessing passwords was inefficient. Modern attacks focus on bypassing the second factor instead. That shift turns the choice of 2FA method into a real security decision, not a formality. Most people face a simple menu. A code arrives by text message, or a code appears inside an authenticator app. Both add a layer of protection. Both also fail in predictable ways. The difference lies in how attackers approach them and how much effort they must invest. Table of Contents Authenticator apps rely on Time-based One-Time Passwords, usually shortened to TOTP. The model comes from IETF RFC 6238. During setup, a QR code is scanned. That QR code contains a shared secret seed. The app combines that seed with the current time to generate a short numeric code that refreshes on a fixed interval, commonly 30 seconds. Common examples include: A detail that matters. TOTP uses a shared secret model. Anyone who obtains the seed can generate valid codes forever until the account owner resets 2FA. That risk exists across all TOTP implementations. The main difference between delivery methods lies in how attackers gain access to the seed or the active codes. SMS 2FA sends a one-time passcode to a registered phone number through mobile carrier infrastructure. The public switched telephone network handles delivery. Independent platforms that avoid carrier mediation, such as those indexed in the bideford.com trusted non-GamStop directory , are not exposed to the same PSTN delivery risks. NIST digital identity guidance places constraints on PSTN-based out-of-band authentication. The guidance treats phone numbers as restricted authenticators and requires extra steps to verify that the number remains associated with a specific physical device. It also treats number changes as binding a new authenticator. A phone number is not a device. Carriers can move numbers between SIM cards and accounts. Attackers rely on that flexibility. SMS-based login codes break down quickly once real attackers enter the picture, because carrier control, human persuasion, and number portability create multiple easy paths into accounts. SIM swapping remains the most common practical breach of SMS-based 2FA. An attacker convinces or tricks a carrier into transferring a phone number to a SIM under their control. From that moment forward, calls and text messages arrive on the attacker’s phone. ENISA’s SIM swapping analysis describes the impact in plain terms. Attackers can circumvent SMS-based 2FA by intercepting OTP messages. Compared with deeper network attacks, SIM swapping offers a low-effort path to account takeover. The issue has grown large enough that regulators responded. The FCC adopted rules requiring carriers to notify customers about SIM changes and port-out requests, among other consumer protections. Port-out fraud moves a number between carriers. The end result mirrors SIM swapping. SMS codes land in the wrong hands. Many services rely on SMS for both login verification and account recovery. Once an attacker controls a phone number, multiple accounts fall together. SMS messages move through carrier...",

  "text": "Ever since Ozempic hit the market as a weight-loss drug, fat activists of the world appear to have been cycling (not literally, of course) between the five stages of grief. There has been anger: one learned fat scholar suggested in 2023 that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic “relate to eugenicist social practices.” Some accused persons who lost weight of having undergone conversion therapy — because there seems to be no historical struggle or oppression that these activists aren’t willing to appropriate for their cause. Other activists reached the “acceptance” stage very early on, even before half of Hollywood dropped a collective 10 dress sizes: a Guardian headline from two years ago claimed that “Ozempic has won, body positivity has lost, and I want no part of it.” This newsletter tackles hot topics with boldness, verve and wit.

Browse here. The author graciously declared that her anti-Ozempic stance was “not to say that fat people owe it to their community to stay fat.” (Let’s stop for a moment to appreciate the irony of a movement that simultaneously insists that one’s weight doesn’t define them, but also threatens to excommunicate from the “community” those who lose too much.) More recently, “body positive” and fat activist Tess Holliday, who makes a living modelling and selling plus-sized clothing, appears to be experiencing the “denial” stage in her Ozempic grief journey. In a video posted to her Instagram account , she insisted that Ozempic is not going to destroy her movement. “I don’t think that Ozempic is killing the body positive, body neutrality space,” she said. “It’s not GLP-1s. Because before that, there were diet pills. There were machines that you stood on that shook the fat away. There were all kinds of promises and pills and programs and camps — all the things. They’ve existed since the beginning of time.” Fact check : for the vast majority of homo sapiens’ existence these past 300,000 years, we have struggled to find enough calories to survive. Being obese and wanting to lose weight is a very modern problem, resulting from our modern privilege of constant access to calorie-dense foods. Superimposed upon Holliday’s video are the words “Diversity matters more than ever,” apparently in reference to the importance of having a population that experiences varying levels of obesity. “I think, now more than ever, being yourself is such a radical act,” said Holliday. “Like, why do you want to look like everyone else? Why do you want to be like everybody else? That’s so freaking boring. It was boring then. It was boring 100 years ago. It’s really boring now. And one thing about me is I’m not...",

This week, Alberta communities have been witness to massive lineups as separatists tour the province collecting signatures for a referendum to take Alberta out of Canada. Crowds were particularly in evidence in Red Deer on Wednesday, where lineups were so long that supporters reportedly had to wait up to three hours to sign their names to a petition sponsored by the group Stay Free Alberta. That petition needs only 170,000 signatures to be accepted by Elections Alberta, and it calls for a referendum to be held on the question of “Do you agree that the Province of Alberta should cease to be a part of Canada to become an independent state?” DRONE VIEW FROM EDMONTON: Aerial footage confirms it — massive momentum for Alberta independence as thousands wait for hours to sign the petition. #AlbertaIndependence pic.twitter.com/fGKZZCvSZI All these petition-signings are being accompanied by events where separatist speakers and organizations are making their pitch for independence.

The idea is very much to balkanize Canada During the heyday of Quebec separatism in the 1980s and 1990s, the usual line from Quebec nationalists was that Canada is a fine country, it’s just that they don’t want to be part of it. Alberta separatism is different in that the idea is very much to pull down the rafters as they leave. The Alberta Prosperity Project (APP), the leading champion for separation, is closely aligned with a similar secessionist group in Saskatchewan. They’ve also been active in forging links with the Parti Québécois to assist each other’s respective secession plans. Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon (who is the favourite to become the next Quebec premier) met with APP leaders last year, and announced afterwards that if their referendum succeeded, he would be the first to recognize Alberta independence. Edmonton Journal reporter Steven Sandor was at the Red Deer event, and he quoted movement leader Kathy Flett as expressing her hope that Alberta secession would likely have a domino effect on the rest of the country. “We’ll pave the way for other provinces to follow our lead,” she said. Separatists are explicitly promising greater wealth (with Canadian dollars) This is probably the element that most distinguishes Alberta nationalism from the Quebec separatist movement. While it’s possible to find Quebec sovereigntists who claim that they would be richer as an independent nation, the usual pitch has...",

  "text": "US President Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports. The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney. Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the sum. Political Hack gets at what’s really going on behind the scenes on Parliament Hill. Wednesdays and Fridays. “Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.” The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory. The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. “The Board of Peace is an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says. ‘Failed institutions’ The",

  "text": "The Pentagon has ordered 1,500 U.S. soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to a state roiled by unrest over an immigration crackdown, U.S. media reported Sunday. The reported preparations come days after President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which enables use of the military to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” — although a day later, he said there was no immediate need for it. The troop deployment plans were first reported by the ABC. The news network cited two unnamed U.S. defence officials as saying 1,500 active-duty Army paratroopers based in Alaska have been put on alert, but the president has not made a final decision on the deployment.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in the United States more than 30 years ago, and any move by the federal government to deploy the military would inflame the standoff between the White House and local authorities in Minnesota. Crowds of protesters have clashed with immigration officers in the midwestern state’s main city of Minneapolis, particularly since the fatal shooting of a U.S. woman by a federal agent on January 7. On Saturday, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that at the direction of Governor Tim Walz the state’s National Guard has been mobilized to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies. As governor, Walz has the authority to deploy the state’s U.S. military reserve during emergencies. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Sunday described the 3,000 federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and border control waging Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as an “occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city.” He told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that the federal agents outnumbered the 600-strong city police force by five to one. He also voiced concern about reports of 1,500 federal troops readying to join them. “This is not about safety. What this is about is coming into our city by the thousands and terrorizing people simply because they’re Latino or Somali, and yeah, people in Minneapolis are speaking up,” Frey said. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that the crackdown would continue “until we are sure that all the dangerous people are picked up, brought to justice and then deported back to their home countries.” The Pentagon deployed some 700 U.S. Marines in Los Angeles in June and July in response to angry protests over aggressive immigration enforcement operations underway there.

  "title": "EU leaders to discuss possible retaliatory tariffs to Trump's economic coercion on Greenland",
  "text": "European Union leaders will hold an emergency meeting in the coming days to discuss President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat as they explore possible retaliatory measures. The leaders plan to meet in person near the end of this week, according to an EU official. Member states are discussing several options for how to respond, including imposing retaliatory levies on €93 billion (US$108 billion) of U.S. goods, according to people familiar with the talks. EU ambassadors met Sunday evening in Brussels as they seek to devise a joint response to Trump’s announcement that he would put 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries on Feb. 1 in relation to their actions in Greenland.

European Council President Antonio Costa said in a social media post after the meeting that member states agreed to remain unified in support of Greenland and Denmark, and that Trump’s new tariffs would be “incompatible with the EU-US trade agreement.” Among the other options being discussed is using a powerful tool known as the anti-coercion instrument, added the people, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive conversations. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested on Sunday the bloc should consider using that new tool, although France backed away from using it in the past after Trump threatened to retaliate. Last year, the EU had approved retaliatory tariffs on €93 billion of U.S. products but suspended their implementation after the two sides reached a trade pact. European lawmakers suggested over the weekend that they will hold off on approving that trade pact, citing Trump’s latest move.

Its effectiveness stems from its professional integration with reconnaissance, AI guidance, and command networks, transforming it from a simple projectile into a capable weapon system. The expert identified three key factors for its success: 🟠the economics of war (high attrition at low cost), 🟠tactical flexibility (loitering capability for \"smart hunting\"), 🟠the exploitation of short-range air defense gaps.Regarding forecasts of a 400% increase in global demand for loitering munitions, Saber deemed the figures logical, calling them the new standard in military doctrine. However, he cautioned that this growth will be uneven; major powers will develop complex integrated systems, while others will rely on cheaper versions, potentially creating an imbalance where offensive capabilities outstrip defensive survivability. The Lancet signals an era of \"low-cost, ultra-high-impact warfare\" that demands a complete rethinking of combat doctrines, Saber stated. The crucial strategic challenge, he warned, is not the proliferation of kamikaze drones themselves, but the development of technologies to counter them once they become widespread.Subscribe to @sputnik_africa Sputnik Africa | X Sputnik Africa feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2026 Sputnik Africa feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 News en_EN Sputnik Africa feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik Africa feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Sputnik Africa sputnik africa sputnik africa 15:08 19.01.2026 (Updated: 15:24 19.01.2026 ) © telegram sputnik_africa / Go to the mediabank Russian Lancet Drone Excels by Adapting to Modern Combat: Egyptian Expert © telegram sputnik_africa / Go to the mediabank Subscribe Russian Lancet Drone Excels by Adapting to Modern Combat: Egyptian Expert Russia's Lancet kamikaze drone's value is an \"economic hammer\" for disabling high-cost targets like radars and artillery at a fraction of the cost, especially against dense air defenses, Egyptian security expert Colonel Hatem Saber told Sputnik Africa.

Shabangu said the move responds to global shifts in AI development, noting that UNESCO committed at the G20 summit in South Africa to train 15,000 people in AI skills.He said Nigeria was “responding towards that call” and taking the lead to close the technological gap between the Global South and the North.“Nigeria is taking the lead to say we also want to be at the forefront of this technological innovation,” he said. On education, Shabangu said AI brings both opportunities and challenges. While he raised concerns about students misusing AI as a shortcut to degrees, he also acknowledged its benefits, saying it “does simplify life in many ways,” from guiding academic research to helping generate accurate reference lists.What are the risks of allowing Western nations to control AI development for Africa?

  "title": "ריינהולד כהן: תוקף פטנט - משמעויות והשפעות על השוק",
  "text": "מהי המשמעות של תקופת פטנט? פטנט מעניק לבעליו מונופול מוגבל בזמן, שמאפשר לו למנוע מאחרים לנצל את האמצאה המוגדרת בו. בישראל, כמו ברוב המדינות, תקופת הפטנט היא 20 שנה ממועד הגשת בקשת הפטנט. בתקופה זאת רשאי בעל הפטנט להפיק רווחים מהאמצאה. בתמורה עליו לחשוף את פרטי ההמצאה לציבור, שכן בקשת הפטנט מתפרסמת כ-18 חודשים לאחר הגשתה, זמן רב לפני פקיעת הפטנט. רק עם סיום תקופת ההגנה יכולים צדדים שלישיים להשתמש בהמצאה ללא חשש מהפרה. שילוב זה של מונופול זמני עם חשיפה מוקדמת מעודד חדשנות, שכן הוא מדרבן גורמים אחרים לפתח שיפורים והמצאות חדשות. כיצד ניתן להאריך תוקף של פטנט ישראלי? במקרה של אמצאות פרמצבטיות, ניתן להאריך את תוקף הפטנט מעבר ל-20 השנים באמצעות מנגנון \"הארכת תוקף הפטנט\" הקבוע בחוק הפטנטים מאז 1996. הארכה אפשרית רק אם הפטנט מתייחס לתכשיר רפואי הרשום לשימוש בני אדם בפנקס התכשירים של משרד הבריאות. הליך רישום התרופה במשרד הבריאות נפרד מהליך רישום הפטנט, אך שני המסלולים נפגשים כאשר נבחנת בקשה להארכת תוקף הפטנט. מהי מטרת הארכת תקופת הפטנט? הארכת תוקף הפטנט נועדה לפצות את בעל הפטנט על הזמן שבו לא יכול היה לנצל את ההמצאה מסחרית, עקב ההמתנה לאישור שיווקי ממשרד הבריאות. גם לאחר שהפטנט אושר, שיווק התרופה אסור ללא רישום מתאים. כאשר הבקשה עומדת בכל התנאים, רשם הפטנטים מעניק צו הארכה המאריך את תוקף הפטנט. כמה זמן ניתן לקבל מצו הארכת פטנט? בישראל משך ההארכה אינו נגזר ישירות מאורך הליך הרישום במשרד הבריאות. ההארכה נקבעת לפי התקופה הקצרה ביותר שניתנה לפטנט מקביל מבין המדינות המוכרות, ארה\"ב, בריטניה, גרמניה, צרפת, איטליה וספרד. בנוסף, ההארכה לא תעלה על חמש שנים מעבר ל-20 שנות ההגנה, והפטנט שניתנה לו הארכה לא יפקע יותר מ-14 שנה לאחר אישור השיווק המוקדם ביותר במדינות האלה. מדוע הארכת פטנטים בישראל קשורה להארכה שניתנה בחו\"ל? הקשר בין הארכת פטנט בישראל לבין הארכות שניתנו בחו\"ל נובע מהשפעת תעשיית התרופות הגנריות המקומית על החקיקה. החוק קובע כי צו הארכה בישראל לא יחרוג מההארכה שניתנה לפטנט המקביל באף אחת מהמדינות המוכרות. כיצד הסוגיה משפיעה על חברות גנריות? לצד הארכת הפטנטים נחקק גם \"פטור בולאר\", המאפשר לחברות גנריות לבצע פעולות פיתוח ורישוי עוד לפני פקיעת הפטנט. כך ניתן להשיק תרופה גנרית מיד עם סיום תקופת ההגנה, איזון הממתן את השפעת הארכת הפטנטים. איך הארכת פטנטים עשויה להועיל לשוק המקומי? הסדר זה עשוי לעודד חברות תרופות בינלאומיות לרשום פטנטים ולשווק תרופות בישראל, לחזק את הכלכלה המקומית ולקדם את תעשיית הביוטכנולוגיה. תרופות שיפותחו בישראל ויוכיחו יעילות עשויות להגיע גם לשווקים בינלאומיים, ישירות או באמצעות רישוי. הכותבת היא עורכת פטנטים בריינהולד כהן ריינהולד כהן לפנייה טלפונית: 03-7109333 למעבר לאתר החברה >> למעבר לעמוד הפייסבוק >> למעבר לעמוד הלינדקאין >> בשיתוף ריינהולד כהן",

  "title": "\"אם זה ייתפס כחודרני, המשתמשים יגיבו מיד\": ChatGPT תתחיל להציג פרסומות",
  "text": "אחרי חודשים של ספקולציות סביב השאלה איך OpenAI מתכוונת להפוך את ChatGPT למנוע הכנסות משמעותי, החברה עושה צעד ראשון לתוך עולם הפרסום. השבוע הודיעה OpenAI כי תתחיל בפיילוט של מודעות ממומנות בתוך הצ'אט. בשלב הראשוני ייצא הפיילוט בארה\"ב, עבור משתמשי הגרסה החינמית ומנויי מסלול Go (חבילת הביניים החדשה שמחירה 8 דולרים בחודש). משתמשי החבילות היקרות יותר - plus, pro, busniness ו-enterprise - לא ייחשפו לפרסומות בשלב זה, על פי הדיווחים. לפי הודעת החברה, המודעות יוצגו בתחתית השיחה ויותאמו לנושא שעליו מדבר המשתמש, אך לא ישולבו בתוך התשובות עצמן. OpenAI מדגישה כי למשתמשים תהיה אפשרות לדחות את מודעות הפרסום, לקבל הסבר מדוע הן הוצגו בפניהם, וכן לבטל פרסונליזציה (התאמה אישית של תוכן למשתמש). בנוסף, החברה מתחייבת שלא להציג פרסומות למשתמשים מתחת לגיל 18. בפוסט הרשמי של OpenAI נכתב כי הפרסום נועד לאפשר המשך גישה חינמית לשירות ChatGPT \"מבלי לסטות מהמשימה שלנו\". עוד נכתב כי \"המודעות לא ישפיעו על תשובות המודל, והחברה אינה מוכרת מידע אישי של משתמשים למפרסמים\". לדברי תומר פוס, CPO בחברת Natural Intelligence שמפתחת טכנולוגיות פרסום, זהו שלב ניסויי מובהק. \"מה ש-OpenAI מציגה בשלב הזה הוא פיילוט; שלב ניסויי שתוצאותיו יקבעו את הכיוון העתידי. לפי המידע ששותף עד כה על ידי החברה, הפרסומות לא יהיו חלק מהתשובות של הצ'אט עצמן אלא יוצגו בנפרד, באופן מסומן וברור, עם דגש חזק על שקיפות ועל חווית משתמש\". לדבריו, סביר שהחדירה לפרסום תתחיל בתחומים שבהם לפרסומת יש סיכוי גבוה יותר להיתפס כתוספת מועילה ולא כהפרעה. \"ההערכה שלנו היא שהכניסה לפרסום תתחיל בעולמות יחסית בטוחים כמו תיירות, פנאי וקומרס, שבהם פרסומת יכולה להיתפס כעזרה אמיתית למשתמש. תחומים מורכבים יותר, כמו ביטוחים, משכנתאות והלוואות, יגיעו רק בהמשך, בגלל המתח המתמיד בין פרסונליזציה לפגיעה בפרטיות\". סגירה תומר פוס, CPO ב-Natural Intelligence צילום: ענבל מרמרי תומר פוס, CPO ב-Natural Intelligence צילום: ענבל מרמרי מעבר לפוטנציאל ההכנסות הישירות, המהלך עשוי לשרת את OpenAI בצורה עקיפה; משתמשים שימצאו את הפרסומות מטרידות עשויים לעבור למסלולים בתשלום - ללא מודעות. \"בסופו של דבר, הפרמטר המרכזי שהניסוי הזה בוחן הוא אמון ואנגייג'מנט\", אומר פוס. \"OpenAI מנסה להוכיח שאפשר לשלב מוניטיזציה בתוך הצ'אט מבלי לפגוע באמינות שלו, ושפרסום יכול אפילו לקצר ולדייק את מסע המשתמש. אם זה ייתפס כמשהו חודרני, אין ספק שהמשתמשים יגיבו מיד\". לדבריו, להצלחה או כישלון של המהלך תהיה השפעה רחבה על כל השוק. \"אם זה יעבוד, זה יסמן כיוון חדש לא רק עבור OpenAI, אלא עבור כל שוק הבינה המלאכותית של המתחרות שלה, שגם הן בשלבים שונים של ניסויים בפרסום בתוך צ'אטים. אפשר להעריך ששחקניות כמו גוגל ומייקרוסופט, אפילו מברכות על כך ש-OpenAI נכנסת ראשונה למים ומכשירה את הקרקע לעידן שבו מודעות הן חלק טבעי מהשיחה\".",

Viele Staaten in Europa stellen sich auf einen Zollkonflikt ein: Die EU prüft Reaktionen auf Trumps Drohungen. © Virginia Mayo/​AP/​dpa Die EU-Kommission zeigt sich angesichts der neuen Zolldrohungen von US-Präsident Donald Trump entschlossen und schließt Gegenmaßnahmen nicht aus . \"Nichts ist vom Tisch\", sagte Wirtschaftskommissar Valdis Dombrovskis vor einem Treffen der EU-Finanzminister. Die EU habe potenzielle Gegenmaßnahmen in der Schublade, falls die USA tatsächlich zusätzliche Abgaben auf europäische Waren verhängen sollten. Derzeit liefen intensive Beratungen über die konkrete europäische Antwort. Die Drohungen aus den USA seien inakzeptabel, sagte Dombrovskis. Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD) forderte vor dem Treffen eine selbstbewusste europäische Haltung. \"Wir lassen uns nicht erpressen\", sagte er und betonte zugleich, eine Eskalation vermeiden zu wollen. \"Wir wollen im Dialog bleiben mit ⁠den USA\", sagte der Vizekanzler. Zur Not müsse ⁠ Europa seine Möglichkeiten an Gegenmaßnahmen aber einsetzen. Ähnlich ‌äußerte sich Frankreichs Finanzminister Roland ​Lescure: \"Europa muss stark sein.\" Zölle dürften nicht als Waffe ⁠eingesetzt werden. Trump hatte am Samstag angekündigt, ab Februar neue Zölle zu erheben – unter anderem gegen Deutschland, Dänemark, Schweden, Frankreich, die Niederlande und Finnland, außerdem gegen Großbritannien und Norwegen. Die Maßnahme soll gelten, bis die betroffenen Staaten einem Verkauf Grönlands an die USA zustimmen. Im Juni soll der Zollsatz auf 25 Prozent steigen. Deutschland und weitere ⁠europäische Staaten hatten mit Protest auf die Drohung reagiert und ‍Widerstand angekündigt.

Tạm gác lại công việc nương rẫy, nhiều ngày nay, ông Sùng A Phử cùng bà con thôn Tân Giang, xã Trịnh Tường có mặt tại nhà văn hóa thôn để chỉnh trang cảnh quan. Với họ, hướng về ngày hội lớn chính là dịp để thể hiện tinh thần đoàn kết, gắn bó của cộng đồng nơi biên giới. \"Qua nghe thông tin tuyên truyền, nhân dân đã rất tin tưởng và phấn khởi, mong rằng Đại hội Đảng thành công tốt đẹp, đời sống nhân dân ngày càng phát triển\", ông Sùng A Phử chia sẻ. Tân Giang là thôn vùng biên, nơi có 100% đồng bào dân tộc thiểu số sinh sống. Những năm gần đây, nhờ sự quan tâm của Đảng, Nhà nước, diện mạo nông thôn nơi đây đã có nhiều khởi sắc. Đường được bê tông hóa, nhà văn hóa khang trang, nhiều mô hình hỗ trợ sinh kế hiệu quả, góp phần nâng cao đời sống vật chất và tinh thần, củng cố niềm tin của người dân vào sự lãnh đạo của Đảng.

  "text": "Từ nhiều thập kỷ qua, cộng đồng người Việt luôn đoàn kết, phát huy truyền thống yêu nước và thể hiện sẵn sàng đóng góp cho đất nước trong công cuộc xây dựng, phát triển và bảo vệ Tổ quốc. Mỗi khi đất nước có sự kiện trọng đại như Đại hội đại biểu toàn quốc lần thứ XIV của Đảng, các thế hệ người Việt ở Pháp bày tỏ ý kiến tâm huyết và mong muốn đất nước sẽ vượt qua mọi thách thức, vững bước tiến tới những mục tiêu lớn hơn. Trong những năm gần đây, từ góc nhìn của một người hoạt động trong lĩnh vực văn hóa-nghệ thuật và đang sinh sống, làm việc tại Pháp, tôi cảm nhận rất rõ sự chuyển mình tích cực và toàn diện của Việt Nam trên nhiều lĩnh vực, từ kinh tế, đối ngoại, cho tới văn hóa và công nghiệp sáng tạo. Việt Nam đang bước vào một giai đoạn mới: tự tin hơn trong việc kể câu chuyện của chính mình với . Các sản phẩm văn hóa, từ điện ảnh, âm nhạc, thời trang, nghệ thuật đương đại cho tới các dự án sáng tạo của người trẻ, ngày càng đa dạng về hình thức, ngôn ngữ và cách tiếp cận. Tôi đánh giá cao những nỗ lực của Đảng và Nhà nước trong việc ban hành các chủ trương, chính sách nhằm thu hút nguồn lực tri thức, tài chính và kinh nghiệm quản trị của kiều bào. Trên thực tế, những chính sách này đã tạo ra một nền tảng tích cực, giúp nhiều người Việt ở nước ngoài cảm thấy được ghi nhận và khuyến khích đóng góp cho quê hương. Tuy nhiên, từ trải nghiệm cá nhân, tôi cho rằng các chính sách này vẫn còn không gian để phát huy hiệu quả hơn nữa, nhất là trong lĩnh vực văn hóa và sáng tạo. Nhiều sáng kiến, dự án của kiều bào, nhất là người trẻ, vẫn đang mang tính tự phát, thiếu cơ chế kết nối dài hạn và thiếu những “đầu mối” đủ linh hoạt để đồng hành cùng họ. Nếu có thêm những cơ chế cởi mở hơn, mang tính đối tác và đồng hành, nguồn lực kiều bào sẽ được khai thác hiệu quả và bền vững hơn rất nhiều. Theo tôi, trọng tâm trong giai đoạn tới nên là đầu tư mạnh mẽ và có chiến lược vào thế hệ trẻ người Việt đang học tập, làm việc và sáng tạo ở nước ngoài để góp phần tích cực và hiệu quả hơn nữa vào việc nâng cao vị thế và hình ảnh Việt Nam trên bản đồ thế giới. Tôi kỳ vọng Đại hội XIV sẽ tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò của văn hóa như một nền tảng tinh thần, một động lực phát triển xã hội và một trụ cột quan trọng của sức mạnh mềm quốc gia, trong đó công nghiệp...",

  "text": "Thời điểm trước thềm Đại hội XIV của Đảng, trên địa bàn tỉnh tiềm ẩn một số yếu tố phức tạp, trong đó nổi lên tình trạng lợi dụng không gian mạng để đăng tải, chia sẻ thông tin xấu độc, sai sự thật; lợi dụng các vấn đề khiếu kiện, tố cáo để xuyên tạc, gây áp lực dư luận; cùng với sự biến động của các loại đối tượng có nguy cơ vi phạm pháp luật. Những vấn đề này, nếu không được phát hiện, xử lý kịp thời, rất dễ tác động tiêu cực đến ổn định chính trị, trật tự an toàn xã hội. Từ yêu cầu đó, Công an tỉnh Quảng Ninh xác định rõ phương châm hành động là chủ động phòng ngừa từ sớm, từ xa; lấy việc bám sát địa bàn, quản lý chặt đối tượng, tăng cường tuần tra, kiểm soát làm giải pháp xuyên suốt. Công tác nắm tình hình được triển khai thường xuyên, liên tục, không chỉ trên thực địa mà cả trên không gian mạng, nhằm kịp thời phát hiện những dấu hiệu bất thường, xử lý ngay từ khi mới manh nha. Thượng tá Nguyễn Xuân Phú, Phó Trưởng phòng chính trị nội bộ cho biết, tình trạng lộng ngôn trên mạng xã hội có xu hướng gia tăng và diễn biến phức tạp, xuất phát từ nhiều nguyên nhân: đặc thù trên không gian mạng với tính ẩn danh cao, tốc độ lan truyền nhanh trong khi một bộ phận người dân còn thiếu ý thức trách nhiệm, hạn chế về kiến thức pháp luật và dễ phát ngôn cảm tính, đăng tải, bình luận tùy tiện mà chưa lường trước được hết hậu quả. Bên cạnh đó, các thế lực thù địch, đối tượng xấu thường xuyên lợi dụng mạng xã hội để tung tin xấu độc, sai sự thật, xuyên tạc, kích động nhằm mục đích chống phá Đảng, Nhà nước. Nhận diện đúng, xử lý sớm và ngăn chặn từ gốc là cách để không gian mạng không trở thành “điểm nóng”. Trong năm 2025, Công an tỉnh Quảng Ninh đã phát hiện 155 trường hợp có hoạt động đăng tải, chia sẻ thông tin xấu độc, sai sự thật. Nhiều trường hợp đã bị xử phạt hành chính; các trường hợp khác được gọi hỏi, nhắc nhở, răn đe kịp thời, qua đó góp phần ngăn chặn từ sớm nguy cơ phát sinh phức tạp. Việc xử lý nghiêm các hành vi vi phạm trên không gian mạng không chỉ nhằm lập lại kỷ cương , mà còn góp phần giữ ổn định dư luận xã hội. Qua đó, nâng cao nhận thức của người dân về trách nhiệm khi tham gia môi trường mạng, hạn chế tình trạng phát ngôn tùy tiện, chia sẻ thông tin chưa được kiểm chứng, gây tác động tiêu cực đến an ninh chính trị và trật tự an toàn xã hội.

Và ở trận derby Manchester lần này, Mainoo chính là người kể câu chuyện ấy theo cách không thể ấn tượng hơn. Mainoo chơi ở vị trí tiền vệ trung tâm, đá cặp cùng trong sơ đồ 4-2-3-1. Anh thi đấu trọn vẹn 90 phút, thể hiện sự chững chạc và toàn diện. Theo thống kê từ , Mainoo chạm bóng 50 lần, đạt tỷ lệ chuyền bóng chính xác 91%. Đặc biệt, anh hoàn thành 22/24 đường chuyền ở nửa sân đối phương và 9/10 ở nửa sân nhà.

  "text": "The lead suspect, Bright Aweh, who has been accused of murdering Immigration Officer Stephen King Amoah, has finally spoken about the charges levelled against him. During his appearance at the Adabraka District Court on Monday, January 19, 2026, Aweh maintained that he was innocent of the allegations. Escorted by police officers after the court proceedings, he spoke briefly to journalists while being ushered into a police vehicle. He expressed hope and optimism that he would emerge victorious from the ordeal. “I didn’t kill my friend. I’m not a murderer. I will pass through it,” he told journalists. Aweh, who is standing trial alongside another accused person, Thomas Zigah, is facing charges of conspiracy to murder and murder after police reportedly found a bloodstained camouflage fabric and a fufu pestle wrapped in polythene at his residence. On July 3, 2025, Amoah went missing after leaving his home to meet Aweh at Ashongman Estates. His body was discovered days later in a drain at Abom Junction. Investigations revealed that the meeting had been arranged following WhatsApp exchanges involving images of cash, allegedly meant to settle a debt. Aweh claimed he had given Amoah GH¢500,000 to pay off a debt and retain the balance. However, inconsistencies in his account raised suspicion. Providing details at a press briefing on Monday, August 4, 2025, the Director-General of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), COP Lydia Yaako Donkor, said Amoah left his home on the night of July 3 after reportedly receiving photos of bundles of cash from Aweh, who had promised to repay a debt. When Amoah failed to return home and his phone became unreachable, a missing person report was filed on July 4, 2025. Police investigations subsequently led to Aweh’s arrest on July 6, 2025. During interrogation, Aweh admitted to meeting Amoah and handing him GH¢500,000 in cash, claiming that GH¢200,000 was to settle a debt, while the remainder was to be held by Amoah. Although Aweh has denied any involvement in Amoah’s death, police say investigations uncovered incriminating evidence, including bloodstains and signs of an attempted cleanup at the prime suspect’s residence.

  "text": "Business mogul, Captain Prince Kofi Amoabeng, has defended former Minister of Finance Ken Ofori-Atta, insisting that allegations against him should not be treated as proof of wrongdoing. Speaking in an interview on JoyNews on Monday, January 19, 2026, Amoabeng highlighted the principle of innocence until proven guilty, stating that he can only be found guilty when the court proves it. “Now, if we want to talk about the finance minister, until the state can prove that, yes, he did a few things here and there, which cost the nation something, he's not guilty. The only unfortunate thing is that either he cannot come or he's not coming,” he said. Amoabeng drew on his own experiences during the collapse of UT Bank, when he faced government investigations but maintained his innocence. “When UT Bank was collapsed, and they told me that they were going to investigate it, I said, okay, bring it on. And I was advised by people that, if you have to leave, I said, leave for what? I have nothing to fear about the system, and therefore I stayed,” he revealed. He noted that Ofori-Atta’s absence from Ghana has created speculation, but cautioned against drawing conclusions. “The only difference is that he decided to leave, or he wasn't well, therefore he left, and I'm not judging. If he had been here, probably he would have been able to clear himself, but staying away then brings people to all sorts of conclusions that you are running away from justice and all those things,” he stated. “But I honestly don't have any opinion on it. He was like a brother to me, and he's still like a brother to me, and I don't bear him any grudge. I certainly don't hate him. I wish that God would help him and resolve the situation for him. I don't bear grudges. I don't hate people. It eats you up, so I've learned not to do that,” he added. Meanwhile, Ken Ofori-Atta is set to appear before a court in the United States of America on January 20, 2026, regarding his immigration status. MAG",

The accused, Iddrisu Yakubu, a 33-year-old car dealer, is standing trial for defrauding by false pretence, contrary to Section 131(1) of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29). According to the prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Portia Nuarko, the accused allegedly defrauded Hafisu Seidu, a police officer stationed in Tamale, of GH¢115,000 in March 2025 at Sowutuom in the Greater Accra Region. Prosecutors told the court that while the complainant was on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, the accused represented to him that he had a 2017 model Toyota Rav 4 for sale at a cost of GH¢80,000. Based on this representation, the complainant paid a total of GH¢115,000, which included additional costs for spraying and finishing works, at the request of the accused. However, upon the complainant’s return to Ghana on July 29, 2025, the accused allegedly informed him that the promised Rav 4 would be replaced with a different vehicle. The complainant rejected the proposal, after which the accused reportedly ceased communication and went into hiding. On August 14, 2025, the complainant allegedly lured the accused under the guise of a business proposal, leading to his arrest. During investigations, the accused claimed he had given the money to a friend for safekeeping but that it was later stolen from the friend’s room. He was, however, unable to lead the police to the said friend, prompting the police to charge him before the court. When the case was called on Monday, December 1, 2025, before Her Ladyship Halimah El-Alawa Abdul-Baasit, sitting as an additional Circuit Court judge, the accused was absent. Chief Inspector Nuarko informed the court that the accused was unwell and had been admitted to a hospital. The prosecution further disclosed that after being granted police enquiry bail, the accused made a payment of GH¢89,000, and applied for the amount to be released to the complainant as restitution. The court granted the application, ordering that the amount be paid to the complainant, who had travelled from Tamale for the proceedings. The case has been adjourned to January 12, 2026, for the plea of the accused person to be taken.",

  "title": "Welcome,",
  "text": "With less than two weeks to the’s January 31 presidential primary, intelligence emerging from within political circles suggests a coordinated attempt to undermine the process by discrediting former Vice President, widely regarded as the frontrunner in the race. According to a source familiar with the developments, the plot involves elements linked to the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) working in alleged collaboration with operatives associated with the Kennedy Agyapong campaign. The strategy, the source says, is two-pronged: first, to smear Dr Bawumia’s image ahead of the vote; and second, to disrupt the election and collation process on voting day. The source alleges that a sustained smear campaign is being rolled out through pro-NDC media platforms and online commentators, aimed at weakening Dr Bawumia’s standing among NPP delegates. Central to the effort, according to the source, is the use of AI-generated content, including manipulated images, videos, and audio, designed to falsely portray Dr Bawumia as politically alien to the NPP and closely aligned with the NDC. The campaign is also expected to aggressively assign blame to Dr Bawumia for Ghana’s recent economic challenges, despite the collective nature of governance under the Akufo-Addo administration. Other alleged narratives include attempts to mischaracterise his religious identity and tolerance, framing his engagement with Christian communities as evidence of “instability”. The source further claims that the smear drive will be amplified by select pro-government media and digital influencers, while simultaneously promoting Kennedy Agyapong as a preferred alternative. As an early sign of this emerging alliance, Kevin Taylor, a known NDC sympathiser and critic of the NPP, recently live-streamed a Kennedy Agyapong campaign activity on his Loud Silence Media platform. As part of the alleged operation, an AI-generated documentary has reportedly been produced by individuals connected to the Kennedy Agyapong campaign. The documentary, the source claims, seeks to reinforce smear narratives through fabricated visuals and audio, and concludes with a direct pitch for Kennedy Agyapong as the candidate of choice for delegates. Beyond reputational attacks, the source warns of a more troubling phase of the plan, disruption of the January 31 election itself. According to the allegations, groups of hired “macho men” are being recruited to cause disturbances at selected polling and collation centres, particularly in Greater Accra, Ashanti, Eastern, and North East regions. Some of these individuals are reportedly expected to pose as state security personnel to undermine the credibility of the sorting and counting process. Senior officials of the NPP have declined to comment publicly on the allegations. However, a member of the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC), speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed awareness of the reports, describing them as “disturbing”. The NEC member disclosed that an emergency meeting is expected this week, during which security concerns surrounding the primaries will be a key agenda item. As the party prepares to elect its 2028 flagbearer, pressure is mounting on NPP leadership and security agencies to ensure a peaceful, credible, and manipulation-free process.",

Abdul Malik Mohammed, the accused, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing unlawful harm, contrary to Section 69 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29). The court, presided over by Her Honour Halimah El-Alawa Abdul-Baasit, a High Court judge sitting with additional responsibility as a Circuit Court judge, admitted the accused to bail in the sum of GH¢10,000 with two sureties. As part of the bail conditions, Abdul Malik Mohammed is to deposit his Ghana Card at the court registry and report to the police once every two weeks until otherwise directed by the court. The prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Kwadwo Aboagye, did not oppose the bail application but prayed the court to impose conditions that would compel the accused to appear for trial. The court further directed the prosecution to file disclosures and witness statements ahead of a Case Management Conference. According to the brief facts presented by the prosecution, the complainant, Abdul Wahab Yakubu, is a tea vendor who operates at the Neoplan lorry station and resides in the vicinity of Kwame Nkrumah Circle. The accused, also a bookman, resides at ‘Ecomog’ in the same area. On September 15, 2025, at about 6:00 a.m., the complainant was selling tea at the Neoplan lorry station when he saw the accused passing by. The complainant reportedly reminded the accused of a cup of tea he had earlier taken on credit and asked him to settle the debt. The request allegedly led to a misunderstanding, which escalated into a fight. In the course of the scuffle, the prosecution said the accused bit the complainant’s nose, resulting in a deep cut on the right side of the complainant’s nose. The matter was reported to the Neoplan Police Station, leading to the arrest of the accused. In his caution statement to the police, the accused denied biting the complainant, but admitted that a fight ensued between them, claiming he only later heard that the complainant had sustained an injury. After investigations, the accused was charged and arraigned before the court. The case has been adjourned for further proceedings.",

On Saturday, January 17, 2026, the Vice President, Professor, travelled aboard the aircraft to Conakry, Guinea, to attend the investiture ceremony of Guinea’s President, Mamadi Doumbouya. The ceremony, held at the Stade Général Lansana Conté, brought together heads of state and high-level delegations from across Africa and beyond. The vice president’s visit formed part of Ghana’s broader diplomatic efforts to deepen engagements with Guinea, building on longstanding historical ties between the two countries. She was accompanied by the Chief of Staff at the Office of the Vice President, Alex Segbefia; the Minister of Foreign Affairs,; and the Vice President’s Spokesperson, Ama Pratt. Professor Opoku-Agyemang returned to Ghana on Sunday, January 18, 2026. The visit symbolised a renewal of relations between Accra and Conakry at a critical moment for the West African region. The Falcon 900EX, with registration number 9G-EXE, was grounded in France from March to November 2025, where it underwent major inspections and repairs. The aircraft was subjected to a compulsory 24-month and 1,600-hour technical inspection, a standard requirement in its maintenance cycle during which technicians uncovered multiple critical defects. These included severe corrosion in the fuel tanks and engine components, necessitating extensive repairs before the jet could be certified airworthy. In 2020 and 2021, the jet experienced no delays at the maintenance facility. However, in 2022 and 2023, the maintenance period was extended by more than two and a half months beyond schedule. In 2024, the aircraft recorded a further two-month overstay. In May 2025, the Minister of Defence, the late Dr Edward Omane Boamah, attributed the deteriorated condition of the aircraft to years of neglect by the previous administration, including failure to honour mandatory manufacturer-level inspections and repairs. He, however, assured the public that the government was exploring cost-effective and safe options to resolve the situation. At the start of his second term, Presidentrelied on a benevolent gesture from his brother and businessman, Ibrahim Mahama, who offered the president and the state unrestricted access to his private jet, an arrangement officials insist came at no cost to the state. The Falcon 900EX was purchased in 2009 and arrived in Ghana in September 2010. It replaced a 37-year-old Fokker 27 aircraft, which had earned the nickname “flying coffin” due to concerns about its airworthiness.",

  "title": "Welcome,",
  "text": "A group of over 500 retirees of the Ghana Armed Forces has threatened to initiate legal action against the Chief of Defence Staff over the Defence Ministry's failure to compute the gratuity and pensions due to them. It is the conviction of the retirees that the delay is in contravention of the Armed Forces (Amendment) Regulations (2020 C.I. 129). Two of the affected persons complained that in spite of scheduled payments for November 13, 2025 and January 4, 2026, they have still not received payments as promised. They claim they have also not been updated on the matter. As a result, they have reminded the Acting Minister for Defence, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, of the need to do the needful, demanding a clear timeline for settlement of the said gratuity and pension due them. Trusting the just leadership of the President, the retirees, who belong to the 1995 and 1996 intakes and the over-aged group, have also petitioned the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Ghana Armed Forces to decisively intervene to rescue the situation. According to them, the delay in paying the lawful entitlements has negatively impacted their families, and they hoped payments would be settled promptly upon completion of decades of loyal and selfless service to the Republic, often under difficult and hazardous conditions. The petitioners claimed that prolonged uncertainty surrounding the payment of their gratuity and pension has affected the sense of closure and dignity that should accompany retirement from national service. The Ministry of Defence per a letter of October 28, 2025 with Reference HA153/604/10 said the concerns raised regarding the computation of gratuity and pension under the Armed Forces (Amendment) Regulations (2020 C. I. 129) have duly been brought to the attention of the Military High Command and that the Chief of Defence Staff has since August 2025 met and assured the affected personnel that the matter is receiving attention. The Chief Director, E. A. Kartey, who signed for the Acting Minister of Defence, said the computation formulae are currently under review to ensure conformity with applicable law and fairness to all affected personnel and implored the retirees to exercise restraint pending the conclusion of the process. The Defence Ministry assured its commitment to address the concerns of all released service personnel in accordance with due process and the governing military regulations. Meanwhile, the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice has acknowledged receipt of the petitioners' concerns. Vivian Opoku-Agyakwa, Chief State Attorney, said the Attorney General and Minister of Justice are awaiting the internal review processes at the Ministry of Defence.",

(askanews) - Il presidente del Guatemala ha dichiarato lo stato di emergenza su tutto il territorio nazionale per trenta giorni per contrastare le gang criminali, dopo l'uccisione di otto agenti di polizia e rivolte con cattura di ostaggi in tre carceri del Paese. Il governo ha annunciato di aver ripreso il controllo di tutti gli istituti penitenziari coinvolti. In un discorso alla nazione, il presidente Bernardo Arevalo ha difeso la linea dura dell'esecutivo: \"Non permetteremo che la violenza e l'intimidazione dettino il corso del nostro Paese. A quei criminali che credono che un governo democratico sia un governo debole, stiamo dimostrando con fatti decisi che si sbagliano gravemente\". \"Per questo - ha aggiunto - ho deciso di decretare lo stato di emergenza su tutto il territorio nazionale per trenta giorni a partire da oggi\". Il presidente ha spiegato che l'obiettivo è garantire la sicurezza della popolazione e colpire in modo diretto le organizzazioni criminali: \"Lo stato di emergenza ha l'obiettivo di garantire la protezione e la sicurezza dei cittadini e, allo stesso tempo, di consentire l'utilizzo di tutta la forza dello Stato, in particolare della Polizia nazionale civile e dell'Esercito del Guatemala, per agire contro le gang e le maras e impedire le loro azioni terroristiche\". Il provvedimento, che dovrà essere approvato dal Congresso, prevede tra l'altro la sospensione del diritto di assemblea e poteri rafforzati per le forze di sicurezza.",

  "text": "Mauritius, 19 gen. (askanews) - Un resort molto apprezzato dagli italiani che rappresenta una delle visioni del gruppo Beachcomber per il turismo a Mauritius: lo Shandrani, a sud est dell'isola, è stato recentemente rinnovato e, grazie anche al nuovo volo diretto ITA da Fiumicino, rilancia la sua offerta al mercato del nostro Paese. \"Lo Shandrani - ha detto ad askanews il General manager del resort, l'italiano Rico Paoletti - è una proprietà secondo me unica a Mauritius, e offre un terreno di gioco eccezionale con i vari punti mare, le diverse spiagge, la dimensione del resort e la capacità di accoglienza con una ristorazione per noi italiani non indifferente. È l'unico resort nell'Oceano Indiano della categoria 4 stelle superior che offre sei punti di ristorazione\". Con un investimento da 20 milioni di euro, il resort mauriziano ora propone diverse novità e valorizza ulteriormente la propria posizione, oltre che la volontà di offrire un servizio curato e consapevole. \"Lo Shandrani di oggi secondo me - ha aggiunto il GM - ha qualche punto indiscutibilmente interessante. Il primo è che abbiamo fatto un piano di formazione a 360 gradi al 100% del nostro team, realizzando una sorta di record visto che parliamo di più di 600 persone. Ci siamo concentrati soprattutto sul definire il senso del dettaglio, che significa curare qualsiasi minima attenzione nei confronti dell'ospite, dettaglio tangibile che secondo me sta davvero facendo la differenza. La seconda cosa su quale farei un highlight è stata la capacità dello chef di ristrutturare tutti i menu della cucina. Dopo, ovviamente ci sono le altre novità, come il nuovissimo ristorante a buffet e la ridefinizione degli altri 5, il restyling di tutte le camere in chiave trppical chic, le nuove rooftop con una terrazza che permette una visione a 360° sul parco marino e sulla spiaggia 'selvaggia' e la zona adult-only, Shandrani for 2, oggi di grande tendenza, con ristorante e bar dedicati\". Altro aspetto centrale in tutto l'ecosistema di Beachcomber è quello della sostenibilità, sia a livello sociale, e anche allo Shandrani si sostengono progetti per le comunità locali, sia a livello di ambiente, perché la natura è un punto di forza del resort. \"Secondo me per il cliente italiano - ha concluso Rico Paoletti - questo è il resort ideale. Perché? In sintesi l'italiano si mette l'asciugamano in spalla, prende una bottiglia d'acqua e ha delle spiagge chilometriche dove si può allontanare della struttura in tutta sicurezza senza incontrare un cane o un gatto\". Anche questa possibilità di vivere le spiagge in modo diverso è una delle caratteristiche che definiscono lo Shandrani Beachcomber, protagonista in un'isola che è sempre più al centro del turismo internazionale.",

Raggiunta la palazzina, i Carabinieri hanno forzato l’accesso alla stanza, riuscendo a bloccare la madre mentre stava soffocando la neonata con le mani e con un cuscino. E' stato immediatamente praticato il massaggio cardiaco alla piccola, che fortunatamente ha ripreso conoscenza dopo pochi istanti. La bambina è stata quindi affidata alle cure del personale sanitario e trasportata presso il Pronto Soccorso dell’Ospedale “San Marco”, dove è attualmente ricoverata nel reparto di Pediatria per accertamenti, ma non in pericolo di vita.

Under Philippine law, only one impeachment proceeding may be initiated against an official within a year, a rule that has previously been used to shut down multiple complaints by recognising the first and dismissing the rest. The new complaint against Marcos was endorsed by just a single congressman, prompting questions about its timing, authorship and prospects in a House dominated by presidential allies.",

  "text": "Hong Kong’s transport minister has outlined plans to develop a blueprint for the nascent low-altitude sector, with local industry players partnering mainland Chinese firms for their first joint overseas trip to explore belt and road markets. Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Monday that the blueprint would cover cross-border electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) that ferry goods and passengers. Speaking at the Second Low-Altitude Summit at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said Hong Kong was well positioned for growth in this sector given its established legal regime and status as a global financial centre, where mainland firms could raise funds. “To develop a low-altitude economy at scale, we must devise a blueprint for the development of low-altitude airspace and infrastructure that ensures safety, efficiency and capability to support extensive operations,” Chan said. According to her, the first pillar of the blueprint was the “regulatory sandbox X” initiative launched at the end of last year, which aimed at tackling challenging projects for the low-altitude economy, such as those involving transporting passengers. The second pillar was to give the industry’s development a firm legal foundation, stressing that authorities would work hard on educating the newly formed legislature on different areas, such as technology, finance and economic development.",

In the broader Middle East and Central Asia region, aggregate growth is projected to rise to 3.9 per cent in 2026, an 0.1 percentage point increase from the fund’s October forecast, the IMF said its latest World Economic Outlook report on Monday.

The expansion of economic activity in the Middle East is “supported by higher oil output, resilient local demand, and ongoing reforms”, but the risks to the regional as well as global economic outlook remain tilted to the downside, the Washington-based fund said. “A significant escalation in geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East or Ukraine but possibly also in Asia and Latin America, could trigger substantial negative supply shocks,” the IMF said. “Disruption to major shipping routes, critical supply chains, and air travel could occur, leading to delays and increased costs. If key infrastructure were damaged, resulting supply constraints could drive commodity prices higher,” the multilateral lender added. The IMF expects global growth to remain steady this year, mimicking its 2025 performance despite significant US-led trade disruptions and heightened uncertainty. The fund’s latest projections indicate that global growth will hold steady at 3.3 per cent this year, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points compared to October estimates, with most of the improvement accounted for by the US-China tariff truce. “This surprising strength reflects a confluence of factors, including easing trade tensions, higher-than-expected fiscal stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, the agility of the private sector in mitigating trade disruptions and improved policy frameworks, especially in emerging market economies,” Tobias Adrian, director of IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department and the fund’s chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a blog post on Monday. Another key driver of resilient economic performance is the continued surge in investment in artificial intelligence. While manufacturing activity remains subdued, IT investment as a share of US economic output has surged to the highest level since 2001, providing a major boost to overall business investment and activity, IMF officials said. “Although this IT surge has been concentrated in the US, it is also generating positive spillovers globally, most notably to Asia’s technology exports,” they said. While the current tech boom raises upside potential if it continues, it also presents risks for the global economy. “Should expectations about AI-driven productivity gains turn out to be overly optimistic and outcomes disappoint, a sharp drop in real investment in the high-tech sector as well as in spending on AI adoption in other sectors and a more prolonged correction in stock market valuations – which have increasingly been...",

As populations and prosperity expand, so does the demand for food, and particularly for a high variety of nutritious and coveted foods, such as animal products and fresh fruits that are resource-intensive to produce and transport. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation forecasts that global food production must grow by nearly 70 per cent to meet this burgeoning demand. Yet today, arable land has shrunk by one third globally since 1961, crop yields are predicted to fall a further 24 per cent due to land degradation and extreme weather, and conflicts will continue to disrupt supply chains, all driving up food scarcity worldwide. The need to build more resilient food systems is increasingly urgent – a shared challenge that extends far beyond national borders. How Fertiglobe is helping to tackle the challenge of food security 02:54 The UAE has leaned into this challenge by investing in innovation and using a well-tested partnership model to generate sustainable and far-reaching impact. Just as the falaj irrigation system transformed agriculture in our region, the UAE remains steadfast in its belief that creating these reliable food systems of the future requires ground-breaking technologies. And these technologies cannot be translated into real-world solutions without the right ecosystem of partners, investors, incubators and policymakers. The good news is that around the world, game-changing innovations for food security already exist. In Sri Lanka, bio-acoustic sensors on coconut palms are providing early warnings of infestation by the highly destructive red palm weevil – responsible for $2 billion in estimated crop losses worldwide. In Kenya, AI-powered smart bins are converting household waste into low-cost organic fertiliser, boosting harvests for smallholder farms while reducing reliance on synthetic fertilisers and easing pressure on soil and the environment. And in the UAE, high-tech farming systems are harnessing microalgae to convert arid desert into arable land. These are just a glimpse of the many promising innovations reshaping the future of food security. But just as crops require soil, water, nutrients and care, these technologies need a robust and supportive ecosystem to evolve into market-ready solutions that can be used at scale.

It took him time to learn the ropes of domestic and foreign policy, and for much of his first term, many in his foreign policy and defence teams were long-term professionals who often pushed back on many of his ideas. In his second term, Mr Trump came back with the experience of a former president and picked a domestic and foreign policy team composed of loyalists who echo and amplify his positions. In the second year of this second term, Mr Trump has been further empowered by his success last year of upending domestic and foreign policy in a revolutionary way. Mr Trump is currently coming off the high of the dramatic US operation in Venezuela . In the Middle East, Mr Trump’s return has had – and will continue to have – significant consequences. The US President started last year with a visit to the Gulf that cemented and deepened the partnerships with America. These relationships, once based largely on energy for security, have deepened to include the future technologies of computing and artificial intelligence as well as large-scale investments and trade corridors, all without dropping the importance of traditional energy concerns. During that visit, Mr Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria – and later met President Ahmad Al Shara – a decision that reversed more than 65 years of strategic hostility between Washington and Damascus and that might help the Levant, including Syria and Lebanon, rise again. Mr Trump started his second term seeking a deal with Iran, and oversaw several rounds of negotiations through his envoys. However, impatient with a lack of progress, he joined Israel in June in waging a 12-day war that targeted Iran’s nuclear programme. Through the rest of the year, Mr Trump stepped up sanctions on Iran, all the while indicating that he was ready for a deal if Tehran would accept zero uranium enrichment and curb its missile programme as well as its regional militia network. During much of the year, Mr Trump gave Israel wide leeway to pursue its policies in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. But he changed position after Israel’s strikes inside Doha in September. After...",

  "title": "Six things not to miss at the Ras Al Khaimah Arts Festival",
  "text": "Set against the atmospheric backdrop of a former pearling village, the Ras Al Khaimah Art 2026 Festival has returned for another year. Running from January 16 to February 8 at Al Jazeera Al Hamra Heritage Village , the event brings together 106 artists from 42 countries for a celebration of art, culture and food. Now in its 14th iteration, this year’s festival introduces the emirate’s first contemporary art biennale, as well as a curated dining programme led by international chefs, hands-on workshops, artist talks and guided heritage tours, all woven into the historic setting of the village. There is free entry to the event, while ticketed experiences start from Dh50. Whether visiting for the art, the food or the chance to explore Ras Al Khaimah’s cultural past , here are six things not to miss. What to see and do at Al Hosn Festival: Performances and coffee ceremonies Read More 1. The new Ras Al Khaimah Contemporary Art Biennale One of the festival’s biggest draws this year is the launch of its first contemporary art biennale. Curated by Sharon Toval, the exhibition is organised into four thematic pavilions that explore spirituality, craft and heritage, women’s narratives and future horizons. Highlights include Hannan Abu-Hussein’s towering installation made from dowry blankets, Kawita Vatanajyankur’s performance-based works examining labour and gender roles, and Francesca Fini’s AI-driven video series Posh on Mars , which speculates on technology-shaped futures. 2. Shopping for art, design and handmade pieces Shopping is very much part of the experience. The Barasti Market brings together local artisans, designers and small food vendors, offering everything from handmade jewellery and crafts to contemporary art, photography and design pieces that can be bought directly from the creators. Fashion and accessories also feature strongly, with stalls selling distinctive garments, traditional Emirati clothing, oud and perfumes. Beyond the market, the village’s restored souq area features on-site shops and galleries open throughout the festival and winter season. This includes the Design Gallery, which doubles as an exhibition space and gift shop for featured artists, as well as smaller stores focusing on locally made, eco-friendly crafts. There are also souvenir stalls positioned near the main exhibition exits, making it easy to pick up mementos. 3. The Hidden Table: Tales from the Village dining experiences Food takes centre stage through a curated programme of limited-seat pop-ups that blend gastronomy with storytelling. Highlights include open-fire cooking from Portugal’s Chama, Mediterranean glamour from Bungalo34, and a closing collaboration with Michelin-starred Restaurant Pine from Northumberland, UK. Prior booking is required for the dining experiences. 4. Meet-and-greets and artist-led conversations One of the festival’s strongest draws is its accessibility. Free, guided art tours through the exhibitions at Al Jazeera Al Hamra Heritage Village give visitors the chance to meet and speak with participating artists and curators, offering insight into how the event's Civilisations theme and how it has been interpreted through different art forms. Artist Amir Taba has postcard-sized variations of his work, such as Les Feuilles du Passe (2025), available for visitors...",

Elvira holds off thrilling McIlroy comeback to take Dubai Invitational crown Read More In 2006, while still a 16-year-old amateur player, he received a sponsor’s invite to play. He did not make the cut, but stayed for the weekend and borrowed a photographer’s camera on the final day so he could get a close-up view of his hero, Tiger Woods. Shared history Dubai in general, and the Desert Classic in particular, have figured prominently in McIlroy’s career , in the time since. The 2009 tournament was the first title McIlroy won on tour.

Tyrrell Hatton won the 2025 title at Emirates Golf Club when he beat New Zealand’s Daniel Hillier by a stroke. McIlroy, who had won in 2024, was two shots further adrift. Starry field As he bids to retain his title, Hatton will be joined by several other players from the LIV Tour, which is where he plays the majority of his season. Perhaps the most celebrated among them is Dustin Johnson ,, the former world No 1, who will be playing the Classic for the first time. “I've heard great things about the event and Emirates Golf Club,” said Johnson, a two-time major champion from the United States. “When you look at past champions like Seve [Ballesteros], Tiger and Rory, you know it's a really prestigious tournament with incredible history.” Hatton wins 2025 Dubai Desert Classic – in pictures Tyrrell Hatton of England poses with the Dallah Trophy after winning the Hero Dubai Desert Classic at Emirates Golf Club on Sunday, January 19, 2025.

Second place in Africa, runners-up in a Cup of Nations, is no great failure in the wider context of where the Atlas Lions have been for half a century. But the overwhelming sensation from their tempestuous, controversial, bitter 1-0 defeat to Senegal in the Afcon final is of deep disappointment. â€œThe chance of a lifetime,â€ Walid Regragui, the coach who has driven Moroccoâ€™s menâ€™s team to some unprecedented heights, called the extra-time loss in the final.

That was in 1976. While it is scarcely possible to imagine that a country so capable, so ambitious for its football and so galvanised will wait another 50 years before ending the Afcon drought, the silver medals handed to their players late on Sunday came embossed with deep regret . Resentment too, because for all the flattery rained on Morocco over the past month, for its largely impressive organisation of the 35th Afcon â€“ an awkward beast of a tournament squeezed into the middle of most domestic seasons, and, as it happened, coinciding with unusually heavy rain in many of the cities â€“ there is a sour aftertaste to the event.

  "text": "Fedaa al-Qedra The Electronic Intifada 17 January 2026 Munira Abu Amer with her daughters. Fedaa al-Qedra In a crammed tent flooded with water and torn by the wind by the seaside in Mawasi, Khan Younis, Iyad Abu Jamea, 49, is trying to support his and his son’s family, a total of 14 people. Around him, tents sit cheek-by-cheek as displaced families face the bitter winter cold with no proper shelter, while rain and sewage flood their homes, creating harsh and unsanitary living conditions. Abu Jamea and his family were displaced from the al-Zana area on the eastern side of Khan Younis. In fact, he told The Electronic Intifada that, since the beginning of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, they had been displaced more than 20 times. “Every time, we took this dilapidated tent with us. For a year and a half, we have been trying to repair it and keep it standing.” During a recent cold spell, when a storm hit Gaza, the tent collapsed. “The tent was uprooted and the fabric torn apart. I received three nylon sheets from UNRWA and built a new tent in preparation for winter weather, but rainwater flooded it while we were sleeping.” The family sought shelter in a neighbor’s tent. “The next morning, we tried to fix what was ruined,” he said. All around him, the family’s possessions, mattresses and clothes, were spread out on the beach to dry. They had managed to repair some tears in the tent, but it was ad hoc work. They need help as winter deepens, Abu Jamea said. That, however, is yet to come. Gaza’s 2 million people need assistance to provide decent shelters as winter deepens. Already, several people, among them children and at least four babies , have died as a result of cold weather and inadequate shelters. But international organizations are themselves dependent on Israel to open crossings. And Israel continues to block or delay the delivery of aid and humanitarian goods, including tents. Even the UK was moved to protest in December that tents it had supplied were delayed for over a year. Exposed Olfat Mukhaimar, 39, a mother of five from the al-Satr al-Gharbi area of Khan Younis said she, her husband and children had little choice but to seek out the coast. Renting scarce land to pitch a tent has become expensive, and she, like everyone else, struggles for money. But the coast is exposed to wind and rain. “I received blankets and mattresses that helped us resist the cold, and we covered the tent with a nylon sheet,” she said about one particularly windy and rainy night. “But it couldn’t withstand the wind. The tent shook violently, and my children screamed.” Her husband Hassan reinforced the tent with sand to keep it from flying away, but Mukhaimar still worries about the location. Her oldest son, Ali, 12, “spent the whole night digging sand berms” to keep out the water, and her daughters feared the sea would pull them in. “The sea...",

  "text": "David Cronin Rights and Accountability 17 January 2026 Chatham House hosted Isaac Herzog when the Israeli president visited London in September. Zak Irfan Avalon Certain topics are taboo if you want to be accepted by the establishment. Julie Norman, an author of the book Gaza: The Dream and the Nightmare , may be practicing self-censorship. While the book contains many important facts, it presents a misleadingly incomplete picture of British policy. A chapter titled “International Responses” puts a positive spin on decisions taken by the current government in London, arguing that “perhaps most notably” it announced during 2024 that 30 out of 350 permits for exporting weapons to Israel had been suspended. Norman and her co-author Maia Carter Hallward fail to properly contextualize that announcement. They do not specify that the suspension will not prevent Britain’s largest arms maker BAE Systems from remaining part of the consortium assembling F-35 “fighter aircraft” for Israel – planes that have been used throughout the genocidal war on Gaza. I contacted Norman asking if the omission had been influenced by her role as an associate fellow with Chatham House, an institute which receives funding from BAE Systems, as well as several British ministries. She replied, “I just became a fellow at Chatham House last month, so I had no affiliation there during the writing or publication of the book. Furthermore, the affiliation would not change how I wrote the book.” According to Norman, “the book is not focused on British policy” and “we could not cover everything in this book.” Norman did not respond to a follow-up question on why she had taken a position with an organization that counts BAE Systems as a donor. Her willingness to accept such a post looks curious, considering that she pointed out in a September 2024 article that Israel has inflicted “extensive damage and loss of life” on Gaza with help from the F-35s. Could there be certain elephants in the rooms of Chatham House which Norman is not permitted to talk about? The range of thought acceptable to this think tank apparently must be kept within certain limits. Despite claiming that “we owe no allegiance to any government or political body,” Chatham House is unmistakably part of the British establishment. Chatham House markets itself as a venue for world leaders to address invited guests. Recent visitors have included Isaac Herzog, an Israeli president with an exterminationist mindset. His October 2023 suggestion that Gaza does not have innocent civilians was quoted in an initial ruling from the International Court of Justice, which deemed as plausible South Africa’s case that Israel had violated the Genocide Convention. Herzog admittedly looked uncomfortable as he was asked a few questions by Bronwen Maddox, his Chatham House host, in September. The mild grilling to which Herzog was subjected does not alter how he should have been arrested as he entered Chatham House, rather than treated as a VIP. The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) also lists Norman...",

Israeli attacks killed at least 10 Palestinians on Thursday, including a child and a senior official of the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas political party. Al Jazeera reported that at least one Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers west of Rafah and another was killed in an Israeli attack on a police post southwest of Gaza City. Two more Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air attack on the al-Khatib family home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, the network added. On Wednesday, 14 January, the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza announced that at least 450 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,200 have been injured since the October agreement. Also on Wednesday, Hatem Abu Saleh, a nurse was killed by Israeli occupation forces in Khan Younis. Reporter Tamer Qashta recorded footage of his family, colleagues and loved ones grieving over his body, which was taken to the Nasser Medical Complex, where he was a member of the nursing staff. Dr. Mohammad Sakr, the director of the nursing department where Abu Saleh worked, told the Turkish broadcaster TRT that Abu Saleh was the target of more than one assassination attempt and had sustained injuries while on duty inside the hospital complex. He had taken a leave from work to help his family prepare for his son’s wedding, but “the occupation’s bullets were faster than his chance to attend his son’s wedding.” Israeli forces killed medical worker Hatem Abu Saleh in a drone strike.

The attacks came after Israeli army forces carried out air strikes and shelling across several parts of the enclave on Monday, Al Jazeera noted. Fares Afanah, the director of Emergency and Medical Services in Gaza, said this week that Israel continues to violate the ceasefire every single day, leaving civilians under constant fire across Gaza. ‼️Fares Afanah, Director of Emergency and Medical Services in Gaza, says the Israeli occupation continues...",

  "title": "New wall threatens thousands of Palestinian families",
  "text": "Zena Al Tahhan The Electronic Intifada 15 January 2026 Abdullah Bisharat, head of the Atouf local council, one of the villages that will be affected, stands on the planned route of the new wall with the Israeli demolition orders. Zena Al Tahhan The Israeli military is building a 22-kilometer-long wall and a 50-meter-wide, off-limits military-only road deep inside the occupied West Bank – a project that will cut Palestinian landowners off from millions of square meters of their lands, displace Palestinian farming communities whose buildings will be demolished and further sever movement between parts of the northern occupied West Bank. In late November and early December 2025, Israeli forces began issuing dozens of demolition orders for homes, farms, greenhouses, livestock pens, water networks and other structures along the planned route of the new segment of the wall in the northern Jordan Valley. Countless Palestinians and their families living off these lands, whether landowners or employed workers, will be severely affected. “The wall will isolate large swathes of privately owned, very fertile land. We are talking about some 190,000-200,000 dunams [190-200 square kilometers] of land that will end up on the other side of the wall,” Abdullah Abu Rahmeh, Director General of the Popular Action Department at the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, told The Electronic Intifada. Set to be built some 12 kilometers west of the Jordanian border , this first stage of the new wall will run between two main Israeli military checkpoints – Tayasir and Hamra – controlling movement between Jenin, Tubas and Nablus in the northern occupied West Bank, and the Jordan Valley, including Jericho. “This area is a vital link between the north, west and east of the occupied West Bank. Access to the Jordan Valley will become extremely difficult, making it easier to further empty the area of its residents,” said Hussein Abu Hatab, a member of the Ein Shibli village local council – one of the villages affected. “Farmers traveling from Tammun or al-Faraa in Tubas to work in the Jordan Valley will struggle to enter and exit the area. This will then make it easier for the occupation to seize [their land],” he told The Electronic Intifada. “Crimson” landgrab The wall will begin from the village of Ein Shibli, east of Nablus, and extend north to the Tayasir military checkpoint east of Tubas. It will slice through the lands of the towns and villages of Tubas, Tammun, Tayasir, Atouf, Yarza, Aqaba and Ein Shibli. It will also turn the villages of Yarza and Ein Shibli into enclaves, with the former to be completely encircled . According to Israeli media, the new section of the wall forms part of the “Crimson Thread” – the name given by the occupying state’s defense ministry to a much larger, $1.7 billion project for a wall that, once completed, will extend for about 500 kilometers – from the occupied Golan Heights on the Syrian border in the north, to the Red Sea near Eilat in the south.

  "text": "Ali Abunimah Lobby Watch 14 January 2026 Zionist group Betar waged a campaign of violence, intimidation and harassment targeting Palestinian, Arab, Muslim and Jewish activists, New York’s attorney general found. Robyn Stevens Brody SIPA USA Zionist group Betar waged a campaign of violence, intimidation and harassment targeting Palestinian, Arab, Muslim and Jewish activists in violation of New York civil rights laws, the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced on Tuesday. The Electronic Intifada has also learned that federal prosecutors are investigating a February 2025 incident in Brooklyn in which – according to the New York attorney general – members of Betar attacked Palestine solidarity protesters and in which at least one activist was stabbed. Betar faces a civil fine of $50,000 but this will be suspended under a settlement agreement with the attorney general in which the hate group agreed to cease its campaign of violence and incitement. Betar will only have to pay the fine if it violates the agreement. “New York will not tolerate organizations that use fear, violence and intimidation to silence free expression or target people because of who they are,” James said. “My office’s investigation uncovered an alarming and illegal pattern of bias-motivated harassment and violence designed to terrorize communities and shut down lawful protest.” New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani welcomed the settlement, noting that “Betar has sowed a campaign of hatred across New York, trafficking in Islamophobic extremism.” However, Mamdani pointedly failed to note that supporters of Palestinian rights have been Betar’s primary targets. For years, Betar has sowed a campaign of hatred across New York, trafficking in Islamophobic extremism and harassing those with whom they disagreed. There is no place for their bigotry in our politics, and I'm grateful for @NewYorkStateAG 's unflagging pursuit of justice. — Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@NYCMayor) January 14, 2026 In December, The Electronic Intifada revealed for the first time that Betar – also known as Betar USA and Betar Worldwide – was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, but its substance was unknown until now. The Electronic Intifada had filed a complaint with the New York attorney general alleging that Betar was raising money in violation of state laws. The attorney general confirmed in the settlement agreement that – as The Electronic Intifada alleged – Betar had been soliciting donations in New York without registering with the state’s Charities Bureau, as required by law. According to the attorney general’s office, “Betar is seeking to dissolve its not-for-profit corporation” and has indicated “that it is winding down operations in New York.” Terror and violence The factual findings of the attorney general’s civil rights investigation into Betar, outlined in the settlement agreement, lay bare the group’s violent extremism in support of Israel. These include Betar describing its mission as to “[g]et Jews armed” and to “attend and disrupt” Palestine solidarity protests. The group described its own members as “cruel” and “aggressive” and asserted that “violence is needed.” “Betar’s violence and harassment are motivated by the anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab...",

  "text": "Deema Fayyad The Electronic Intifada 14 January 2026 Awad Nofal has been missing for two years. The family believes he is detained by Israel, which denies any knowledge. Photo courtesy of the family Almost exactly two years ago, in January 2024, we were forced to flee our home in Khan Younis. The city was besieged, the bombardment had intensified and the Israeli military was drawing closer. After several desperate attempts, we finally managed to find a truck that could take us out of the area. Our closest neighbors, the Nofal family, had been preparing to leave with us. But there was no space on the truck. As our vehicle started moving away, we all looked back desperately at our helpless neighbors, whom we tearfully bid farewell. The next day, we received the news that the Israeli military had established a “safe corridor” for people leaving Khan Younis, and that Awad Nofal, 69, father of seven, had been detained while the family was passing through. The news weighed heavily on our hearts, especially my father’s. We had lived side by side with the Nofal family in the Khan Younis refugee camp for over 40 years. Our relationship is far deeper than that of old neighbors. It represents a long-forged bond of love, affection and friendship. Awad – whom I always knew as Ammo (uncle) Awad, a sign of respect – was my father Muhammad’s closest friend. They used to sit together daily in my father’s mini-market, talking and laughing for hours over cups of coffee. Awad was like a second father to us. I grew up with him coming into our home to install a fan, fix the television or put up shelves. He is a skilled electrician and repairman who never hesitated to offer help or advice to anyone in need. There is hardly a house in our neighborhood that does not owe something to Awad and his countless favors. Since his detention, my father has never stopped remembering his friend, constantly expressing concern for his uncertain fate. “Awad used to love this meal,” he suddenly announced once while eating mulukhiya – a jute mallow stew usually served with rice and chicken – before quietly asking: “I wonder, dear Awad, where are you now?” Awad has a heart condition, and one of my father’s biggest worries is whether his friend’s “fragile heart” has been able to withstand Israeli detention, with all the cruelty and torture it reportedly entails . Looking for answers My father never grows tired of asking for updates. He refuses to forget his lifelong friend or come to terms with his absence. I always felt that my father’s questions were a way to provoke a conversation about Awad – that he wanted to hear happy memories from us, to keep him from the dark scenarios running through his mind about his friend’s fate. But we have nothing to tell him. Other than that Awad is missing, nothing is certain. Since his arrest, Awad’s family has spared no...",

A sign placed on the grave reads: “To preserve their dignity and ensure future identification, please do not remove.” Doaa Albaz ActiveStills On 19 October 2025, Gaza’s Ministry of Health announced it had received 150 bodies from Israel. The corpses were handed over by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and their return followed the ceasefire agreement that came into effect on 10 October. With at least 8,000 people still missing in Gaza – presumed either buried under rubble, in mass graves dug by the Israeli military or detained by Israel and held outside Gaza – determining the fate of the missing is a top priority. But as Israel still keeps crossings into Gaza shut to all but the bare minimum of aid, Gaza’s authorities are without heavy machinery to shift millions of tonnes of rubble or relevant scientific materials to properly identify sometimes deeply decomposed corpses. This undermines efforts to provide information to families of the disappeared. It was left to the forensic teams at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis to examine and",

  "text": "Ali Abunimah Rights and Accountability 13 January 2026 Former Swiss federal police director Nicoletta della Valle. ( Fedpol ) On 12 January, I filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor of the Canton of Zurich against Nicoletta della Valle, the former director of Fedpol, Switzerland’s national police agency. The complaint alleges abuse of office related to my illegal arrest and detention in Zurich a year ago. On 24 January 2025, I entered Switzerland legally. The following day, I was abducted off the street by plainclothes officers while I was on my way to speak at a public event about the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza. I was forcibly dragged into an unmarked car and taken to prison. I was detained for three days, while being deprived of contact with my family and the outside world, then taken to the airport, handcuffed and in a cage, and deported. Unconstitutional actions In a ruling dated 19 December 2025, the Administrative Court of the Canton of Zurich determined that my arrest and detention violated the Swiss constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. 🎉Victory!

The parliamentary report and the files obtained by my lawyers confirm that prior to my arrival, Fedpol had rejected a request from the Zurich Canton that I be banned from entering Switzerland. Fedpol denied the request after concluding that my views were protected by freedom of expression and that I presented no security threat to Switzerland. The next day, della Valle overruled the lawful and considered decision of her own police agency and imposed the ban, leading to my illegal detention. The parliamentary report states that della Valle did so based on no new evidence, in violation of standard procedures and without any documentation of why the initial decision was suddenly overturned. Lucrative role with Israeli arms investors Della Valle retired from Fedpol shortly after these events and took up a lucrative role with Champel Capital, an Israeli firm that invests in the weapons industry. Its founder, Amir Weitmann – an activist with Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party – has been an outspoken supporter of Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza and advocates for the entire Palestinian population of the territory to be ethnically cleansed to Egypt. Champel Capital’s senior partners include retired Israeli general Giora Eiland, who has repeatedly advocated for the collective punishment and starvation of civilians in Gaza.

  "text": "Michael F. Brown Media Watch 12 January 2026 New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani tweeted nothing about genocidal chanting, violent threats and anti-Palestinian racism exhibited on 8 January by pro-Israel counter-demonstrators. Kyle Mazza CNP The New York Times , Politico and CNN have in recent days promoted criticism of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani over his decision to cancel executive orders signed by his predecessor – Eric Adams – pertaining to the misleading and anti-Palestinian IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and the ban on boycotts of Israel by city agencies. Palestinian voices are totally absent from their news coverage. Instead, The New York Times highlights that “a coalition of major Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and the UJA Federation of New York, issued a joint statement opposing the cancellation of the executive orders.” One of the quotations included in the article from the coalition statement claims, “Singling out Israel for sanctions is not the way to make Jewish New Yorkers feel included and safe, and will undermine any words to that effect.” The statement attributes to Jewish New Yorkers a monolithic view of Israel and sanctions that does not exist. New York Times articles have twice in early 2026 presented the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement as merely an effort to “economically isolate” Israel. This shortchanges the BDS movement for Palestinian freedom and equal rights. The articles say nothing about the Palestinian BDS National Committee’s demands of ending the Israeli occupation, securing equal rights for Palestinians and insisting on the right of return to lands from which Palestinians were dispossessed decades ago. Where the newspaper did better was in pointing out some of Mamdani’s concerns about Israel. “He has called Israel an apartheid state. He has backed accusations made by international and Israeli human rights groups, and a United Nations panel, that it has committed genocide in Gaza.” And the newspaper detailed that Mamdani “has said Israel should ensure equal rights for followers of all religions instead of favoring Jews in its political and legal system.” The Gaza genocide, apartheid and absence of equal rights for Palestinians should all be covered more by The New York Times . I don’t expect these facts to be routinely reported as facts any time soon, but naming them far more often and exploring them as subjects of great interest to readers would be a good start. Including Palestinian voices in such articles is an obvious bare-minimum requirement. Politico Politico , for its part, wrote that Mamdani became mayor on 1 January with “deep rifts remaining between his administration and some members of the city’s Jewish community who have been critical of his past comments opposing Israeli military action in Gaza and its right to exist as an explicitly Jewish state.” But not a word is said in the article to expose the reality that supporting an “explicitly Jewish state” means discriminating against Palestinians. Adalah, a human rights group, has documented “over 65 Israeli laws that discriminate directly or...",

Pour la première fois, l'extrême droite se qualifie pour un second tour à l'élection présidentielle. Son candidat, André Ventura, leader du parti Chega (\"Assez\"), n'a que peu de chances de remporter le scrutin. Mais son score marque une nouvelle percée de l'extrême droite dans les urnes. Aux législatives de mai dernier, déjà, Chega est devenu pour la première fois le principal parti d'opposition au gouvernement, devant les socialistes. Ces dernières années, l'instabilité politique et les élections à répétition au Portugal affaiblissent les grands partis traditionnels. Le second tour se tiendra le 8 février André Ventura tire son épingle du jeu et promet de répondre aux problèmes des électeurs. Le taux de pauvreté dans le pays est à son plus bas niveau depuis 20 ans. Mais les Portugais font toujours face à la crise du logement et à un faible pouvoir d'achat.

Une matière visuelle qui continue d’alimenter la fascination en ligne. Aujourd’hui, Maria Carolina n’est plus seulement une héritière, elle est influenceuse. Sur Instagram, elle met en scène défilés de mode, voyages de luxe et avant-premières très médiatisées, comme celle de la prochaine saison de Bridgerton . Une série Netflix qui fantasme une aristocratie élégante, bals somptueux et fortunes anciennes. C’est précisément cette esthétique qu’elle incarne. Le \"old money\", expression très populaire sur les réseaux sociaux pour désigner les vieilles fortunes héritées, par opposition à l’argent nouvellement acquis. Une mise en scène glamour de la noblesse, qui séduit une partie de la jeunesse et signe le retour en grâce d’un imaginaire très conservateur.

Cette apparition intervient à un moment clé, alors que Marine Le Pen est fragilisée par ses ennuis judiciaires et que Bardella s’impose comme l’héritier naturel du parti. Mais cette image brouille aussi son récit politique. C’est précisément ce que soulignent Ariane Chemin et Ivanne Trippenbach dans un article publié dans Le Monde . Les journalistes interrogent la cohérence entre le discours de Jordan Bardella, qui se présente comme le porte-parole d’une France populaire méprisée par les élites, et cette apparition très visible aux côtés d’une héritière issue d’une famille extrêmement fortunée.

  "text": "Ce texte correspond à une partie de la retranscription du reportage ci-dessus. Cliquez sur la vidéo pour la regarder dans son intégralité. Après les menaces de surtaxes douanières de Donald Trump , l'Union européenne serre les rangs et hausse d'un ton. En première ligne, Emmanuel Macron évoque l'outil anti-coercition. Une idée soutenue par la présidente de l'Assemblée nationale, dimanche 18 janvier. \"C'est un outil qui est parfaitement adapté à la situation actuelle. Il faut évidemment ne pas hésiter à le brandir, voire à l'utiliser, si cela s'avérait nécessaire\" , a affirmé Yaël Braun-Pivet sur RTL. Il s'agit d'un instrument de dissuasion contre tout pays qui impose des restrictions commerciales à l'un des 27 États membres de l'UE. Il offre un éventail de représailles, comme le gel de l'accès aux marchés publics européens, le blocage des investissements et des restrictions d'accès au marché des services. L'outil n'a jamais été utilisé Adopté en 2023, cet outil n'a jamais été utilisé. Mais, aujourd'hui, le moment est opportun, selon cet expert. \"C'est le moment, et j'irai même encore plus loin, si on ne l'utilise pas aujourd'hui, alors pourquoi a-t-on voté un tel outil ? C'est vraiment pour moi le cas par excellence qui justifie l'utilisation de cet instrument anti-coercition et je pense même qu'il faut le faire rapidement\" , estime Sébastien Jean, professeur au Conservatoire national des Arts et des Métiers. Pour l'activer, la mesure doit être approuvée par 55% des États, représentant au moins 65% de la population de l'Union européenne. Une nouvelle crise voit le jour alors que l'accord sur les droits de douane conclu l'été dernier avec les États-Unis n'a pas encore été ratifié par les Européens.",

  "title": "Budget 2026 : pour sauver la fin du quinquennat, Sébastien Lecornu solde le macronisme",
  "text": "Pour essayer de faire adopter le budget, Sébastien Lecornu continue de multiplier les concessions , en particulier aux socialistes. Trois semaines après Noël, le Premier ministre avait encore des cadeaux plein sa hotte pour soutenir le pouvoir d’achat. Et il a enchaîné directement avec l’ouverture de la période des soldes. Car, pour sauver sa peau de Premier ministre et, au-delà, la fin du quinquennat du chef de l’État, Sébastien Lecornu est condamné à détricoter le macronisme. D’où ces remises spectaculaires ! Sur la politique de l’offre, la baisse des dépenses publiques ou l’effort de désendettement : tout doit disparaître, ou presque. De quoi réjouir le premier secrétaire du PS, Olivier Faure. Il a indiqué, samedi 17 janvier, que son groupe de 69 députés ne devrait pas censurer le gouvernement. On ne sait pas encore si tout cela suffira à doter le pays d’un budget, mais ces nouveaux reculs illustrent l’engrenage fatal dans lequel l’exécutif est engagé depuis des mois. Au pied du mur Sébastien Lecornu n'avait sans doute pas d'autres choix. Il répète qu’il est le \"Premier ministre le plus faible de la Ve République\", et c’est assez vrai. Faute de majorité, il est contraint d’enclencher la marche arrière, de lâcher beaucoup. Et c’est d’autant plus douloureux qu’il le fait par à-coups. Il a attendu d’être au pied du mur, à 72 heures de la fin du match, après trois mois de débats, 35 séances, 125 heures de discussions dans l’hémicycle et 244 incidents de séance — tout est consigné au Journal officiel — pour distribuer une nouvelle salve de cadeaux coûteux. Et il y a trois mois, il avait commencé la négociation du budget de la Sécurité sociale par un autre très gros cadeau, qui a mis les socialistes en appétit : la suspension de la réforme des retraites, la seule véritable réforme d’ampleur de ce second quinquennat raté. Pour Emmanuel Macron, la fin de mandat s’annonce douloureuse . Un vrai supplice. Il doit laisser Sébastien Lecornu dépecer son œuvre pour éviter la censure et une nouvelle crise politique. En voulant s’épargner une cohabitation avec ses opposants, le chef de l’État s’est en réalité infligé une cohabitation avec l’un de ses fidèles, contraint de faire ce sale boulot. Emmanuel Macron met lui aussi la main à la pâte pour défaire son bilan. Pour tenter de calmer les paysans, lui, l’Européen partisan du libre-échange, a dû voter contre le traité signé avec le Mercosur, isolant ainsi la France au sein de l’Union européenne. Il lui reste encore seize mois à tenir. C’est long. À ce rythme, au printemps 2027, que restera-t-il de son bilan ?",

  "title": "Immobilier : entre reprise et vigilance, comment se dessine 2026 ?",
  "text": "Après plus de deux ans de baisses des transactions, les réseaux et les fédérations de l'immobilier reconnaissent que l’année 2025 a été synonyme de rebond et a vu le redémarrage de l’activité. Au niveau des transactions, nous serons autour des 940.000 ventes (+11% sur un an au niveau national). Certes, c'est encore loin du record de 1,2 million réalisé post-Covid, en 2021, mais cela restera une bonne année. Pour autant, la reprise est-elle actée ? Non, la reprise est fragile. 2025 a marqué plusieurs leviers. D'abord des taux d’intérêt autour de 3%, ce qui a redonné de la visibilité et du pouvoir d’achat. Il faut rappeler que durant la période 2022 - début 2024, les taux étaient passés de 1 à 4% ce qui avait littéralement bloqué le marché. Ensuite, les prix se sont plutôt stabilisés l'an dernier. C’est une tendance, il y a eu quelques hausses, des ajustements dans les grandes villes comme Paris, Lyon et Bordeaux, plutôt de légères baisses dans les villes moyennes. Enfin, la production de crédits a progressé, et le Prêt à taux zéro a soutenu les projets de primo accédants, ce qui a redonné du dynamisme au marché. Les signaux à surveiller en 2026 Pour l'année en cours, il va falloir surveiller les conditions d’emprunt . Les banques vont-elles maintenir des taux autour de 3% ? Depuis le début de l’année, certaines d'entre elles ont légèrement relevé à la hausse leur barème mais, actuellement, il n’y a pas de mouvement d’ampleur à l’horizon. Plus que jamais, une forte concurrence existe entre les banques pour capter de nouveaux clients. Le prêt immobilier reste un produit d’appel. Il faudra surveiller aussi les évolutions politiques, économiques voire géopolitiques, l’attitude de la BCE (Banque centrale européenne), le taux d’emprunt d’Etat (L’OAT 10 ans, plus élevé que pour les particuliers). Des réformes restent également en attente de vote du budget (s’il y en a un) comme Ma Prime Rénov ( actuellement suspendue ), le statut du bailleur privé également, ou encore l’élargissement du Prêt à taux zéro. Quant aux prévisions 2026, à ce stade, la plupart des réseaux et des fédérations projettent de légères hausses de prix et des ventes presque similaires à 2025. Y a-t-il des secteurs qui restent en souffrance ? La location dans le privé demeure très compliquée. Il est de plus en plus difficile de trouver des locations , de longue durée notamment, dans les grandes villes. Et la construction de logements demeure incertaine : baisse des permis de construire, des mises en chantier, des ventes, des mises en vente. Sans oublier que 20% des opérations ont été retirées, abandonnées pour des raisons économiques. Faire du logement un bien de première nécessité, réhabiliter, transformer l’existant et produire des logements abordables, voilà les principaux défis à relever. Le logement sera l'un des thèmes phares des élections municipales. L'immobilier est une chaîne, la chaîne du logement. Cela concerne aussi l’emploi, la mobilité, les transports, l’aménagement du territoire. Tout est lié.",

Budget : \"Des annonces très positives\" \" Les annonces [du Premier ministre sur le budget] sont très positives \", juge samedi 17 janvier sur franceinfo Philippe Brun, député de l'Eure et négociateur socialiste pour le budget. Sébastien Lecornu a notamment annoncé vendredi que le projet de budget de l'État contiendrait une augmentation de \" 50 euros en moyenne \" de la prime d'activité, aucune augmentation d'impôts pour les ménages, 2 000 postes en plus dans l'Éducation nationale, les repas à un euro pour tous les étudiants, ou encore 200 millions pour le fonds vert. Ces mesures \" correspondent à ce que nous avons négocié âprement avec le Premier ministre \", assure le député socialiste. Concernant la hausse de la prime d’activité, \" le montant est important (...), on a obtenu autant que les gilets jaunes”, se félicite Philippe Brun qui fait part de sa \"satisfaction\" . Il reste toutefois prudent sur la copie finale du gouvernement sur le budget , et plus particulièrement sur la partie recettes : \"Ces propositions-là, qui sont d'ailleurs celles du contre-budget du Parti socialiste, nous les financions avec un certain nombre de recettes supplémentaires\", explique-t-il. Or, \"ces recettes, [Sébastien Lecornu] n’en a pas parlé\", regrette le député de l’Eure. \"Attention à ce que les économies ne soient pas faites sur d'autres ministères ou sur d'autres postes qui toucheraient directement les classes populaires et les classes moyennes\", prévient-il. Les ordonnances, \"un coup d'Etat très antidémocratique\" Faire passer le budget par ordonnances serait \" une rupture avec toute notre histoire démocratique \", prévient le député socialiste de l’Eure Philippe Brun, sur franceinfo. Ce serait \" un précédent catastrophique \" et un \" coup d'État très antidémocratique \", insiste-t-il. \" Les députés ont été inventés à la Révolution française pour consentir à l'impôt et s'assurer du bon usage des deniers publics au nom des citoyens \", rappelle Philippe Brun. Si le gouvernement décidait d’imposer un budget par ordonnances, \" on interdirait au Parlement de voter le budget et cela, nous ne pouvons pas l'accepter \", martèle-t-il. Le \"monsieur Budget\" du PS serait \" le premier à écrire une motion de censure \", si le gouvernement avait recours aux ordonnances, promet-il. Cette procédure donnerait selon lui au gouvernement \" tous les pouvoirs, dont celui de se passer du Parlement, de marcher sur le Parlement \" et formerait un \"précédent absolument terrible pour la suite\". \" Il suffirait juste de déposer 4 000 ou 5 000 amendements pour passer 70 jours et ensuite vous faites passer votre budget tranquillement \", alerte-t-il.",

La défaite est sévère, mais sur le plateau de France 3 il y en a une qui se réjouit, se disant \"extrêmement contente du résultat\" : c'est Marine Le Pen. Elle a 33 ans, elle est conseillère régionale du Nord-Pas-de-Calais et c'est la première fois qu'elle est propulsée sur un plateau de télévision. Le FN assure que c'est un concours de circonstances : le parti est trop sollicité et il envoie la fille du chef. Elle n'a pas l'air impressionnée, elle connaît les médias : pendant la campagne, l'ex-avocate faisait partie de la cellule qui a géré l'image de son père. Ce soir-là sur le plateau de France 3, l'image que Marine Le Pen donne d'elle-même est celle d'une femme pleine d'assurance : les coudes sur la table, le buste en avant, elle a le sourire satisfait, une mauvaise foi prodigieuse… et des formules définitives. \"Aujourd'hui, assène-t-elle, Jean-Marie Le Pen est à la tête du premier mouvement de France.\" Quand on lui demande comment va le président du FN, que l'on sait déçu et furieux, \"il est toujours très serein\" , affirme-t-elle. Et elle ajoute : \"Le combat commence !\" Puis elle part faire la fête avec Frédéric Châtillon notamment, un vieux copain néofasciste, qui participe à son ascension politique. Naissance d'une \"bête de télé\" Une quinzaine de jours plus tard, on la retrouve sur France 2. Plus motivée que jamais, elle fond sur Jean-Luc Mélenchon, figure alors de la gauche socialiste, qu'elle accuse d'être en partie responsable de la désaffection des Français envers des politiques, qualifiés de malhonnêtes. Chaos sur le plateau, comme une enfant qui sème la zizanie dans la classe et qui prend l'air innocent sans être dupe, Marine le Pen joue, s'amuse… Une bête de télé est née. Dans la foulée, toujours en 2002, changement de registre : elle part sur le terrain. Elle se présente aux législatives dans la 13e circonscription du Pas-de-Calais. En campagne dans les rues de Lens, oubliée l'agressivité : un peu à la manière des chats qu'elle adore — elle est officiellement éleveuse de chats, aujourd'hui — elle rentre les griffes. Comme elle est en train de devenir une attraction médiatique, les journalistes la suivent quand elle fait du porte-à-porte. Sur France 2, la benjamine du clan Le Pen confie qu'elle est \"le clone\" de son père. \"J'essaie de trouver des sujets où je ne suis pas d'accord avec lui , explique-t-elle. Mais je n'arrive pas à en trouver. Je vais bien finir par réussir, quand même !\" \"\"Même humour, même discours, mêmes méthodes que son père... le sourire en plus.\"\" Un journaliste de France 3, en 2002 Cette année-là, Marine le Pen perd les élections législatives mais elle gagne la notoriété.

  "title": "Year One of Project 2025: Tracking the Trump Administration’s Devastating Campaign Against Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights",
  "text": "During the 2024 campaign, President Trump repeatedly tried to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation’s far-right policy agenda Project 2025,1 claiming to know nothing about the framework or the people behind it (despite many of its authors having roles in his first administration). One year in, however, it is clear that Project 2025 is serving as the Trump administration’s playbook for implementing an extreme policy agenda at the federal level, attacking sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) both domestically and globally.  While the crisis in sexual and reproductive health access started long before 2025, Trump’s return to the White House has been marked by a slate of regressive policies and actions. These include steps explicitly laid out in Project 2025: removing Biden-era protections for abortion access post-Dobbs; drastically undermining access to contraception, gender-affirming care and other reproductive health services; and dismantling evidence-based resources related to public health in general and sexual and reproductive health in particular. Underlying all those actions is a reliance on misinformation, inaccurate language and inflammatory rhetoric that create stigma, confusion and fear around many essential SRH services. As modeled in Project 2025, this approach deploys anti-abortion, anti-science and transphobic language that undermines the autonomy and erases the identities of targeted communities. Taken together, the administration’s policies and rhetoric will undoubtedly have devastating and sustained impacts on sexual and reproductive health and well-being in the United States and globally.This fact sheet summarizes key components of Project 2025’s anti-SRHR agenda and then describes how and to what extent each has been implemented during the first year of the current administration.Attacking Abortion Access",

  "title": "Medication Abortion Remains Critical to State Abortion Provision as Attacks on Access Persist",
  "text": "Updated May 7, 2025. See note below. New data from the Guttmacher Institute reaffirm that medication abortion is a fundamental component of abortion provision in states across the country, even as anti-abortion policymakers use all levers of government to target this safe and effective method of abortion care. For the first time, Guttmacher’s Monthly Abortion Provision Study includes state-level estimates of the proportion of abortions provided via medication in 2023 in states without total abortion bans. It also provides state-level data on the proportion of abortions provided by online-only clinics in 2023.As we learn more about how people access abortion care across the states in a post-Roe v. Wade environment, many policy attacks on medication abortion now target telemedicine provision or attempt to unnecessarily complicate the process of prescribing and dispensing medication abortion in person. And, despite clear medical evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of medication abortion obtained in-person or online, anti-abortion policymakers often ignore that evidence and promote false claims about risks.Latest Findings on Medication Abortion Provision by StatePer the most recent data, medication abortion accounts for the majority of abortions provided in most US states without total abortion bans. These results expand on Guttmacher’s finding that medication abortions accounted for 63% of all clinician-provided abortions in 2023 in states without total abortion bans. Proportions of medication abortion provision were lowest in the District of Columbia (44%) and Ohio (46%), and highest in Wyoming (95%) and Montana (84%; see table).   Our counts include medication abortion prescribed at an in-person clinic visit, or via telemedicine from a brick-and-mortar or online-only clinic (including from out-of-state providers operating under the protection of shield laws), for states without total abortion bans. The new estimates indicate that one in 10 (10%) abortions in 2023 were provided by online-only clinics, with proportions ranging from 7% (California, DC and New York) to 60% (Wyoming).",

  "title": "Medication Abortion Accounted for 63% of All US Abortions in 2023—An Increase from 53% in 2020",
  "text": "New Guttmacher Institute research from the Monthly Abortion Provision Study shows that there were approximately 642,700 medication abortions in the United States in 2023, accounting for 63% of all abortions in the formal health care system. This is an increase from 2020, when medication abortions accounted for 53% of all abortions. Medication abortion using mifepristone was first approved for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and reliance on medication abortion has increased steadily as it has become more accessible over time. The two-drug combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is the most common medication abortion regimen offered by US providers, and decades of research have established that medication abortion using mifepristone is highly safe and effective. Increased access to and use of medication abortion is likely one reason why the overall number of abortions in the formal health care system increased 10% nationally between 2020 and 2023. The medication abortion counts for 2023 do not include self-managed medication abortions that take place outside of the formal health care system or abortion medication mailed to people in states with total abortion bans. While there are no comprehensive data on the number of self-managed medication abortions in the United States, evidence suggests they have been increasing in the past several years. Therefore, the total count of medication abortions nationally is higher than our count of those offered within the formal health care system. Unfortunately, gains in access to and use of medication abortion are at risk. The US Supreme Court will hear a case on March 26—Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA—that uses low-quality science to challenge access to medication abortion using mifepristone. The Court could restrict the ability to mail mifepristone directly to patients and reinstate the requirement for the drug to be provided in person. If outdated and medically unnecessary restrictions are placed on the provision of mifepristone—in contrast with the FDA’s evidence-based protocol—access to abortion across the country would be greatly impacted. Medication Abortion Has Become More Widely Available For many people, medication abortion is more accessible than a procedural abortion. In 2021 (the most recent year with available data), 40% of facilities known to provide abortion care offered only medication abortion. And, starting in 2021, the FDA lifted medically unnecessary restrictions that had required in-person provision of mifepristone. That regulation change, which the FDA finalized in January 2023, meant that health care providers and online pharmacies could mail abortion medication to patients, including those who live far from a provider or are otherwise unable to make an in-person visit. In addition, brick-and-mortar pharmacies can now become certified to dispense and fill mifepristone prescriptions, so access is expected to continue growing. The number of US providers offering a telemedicine consultation—by video, phone call, text or online platform—and mailing abortion pills increased from 7% of all providers known to offer medication abortion in 2020 to 31% in 2022. Online-only clinics, after first appearing as a new type of abortion provider in 2021,...",

  "title": "De l’Épiphanie à TikTok : la galette des rois version Dubaï séduit les gourmands",
  "text": "Officiellement, la galette célèbre l’Épiphanie, le 6 janvier, et la visite des Rois mages. Mais dans les faits, personne n’a jamais vraiment accepté de s’en tenir à une seule date. D’abord pour une raison très simple : le calendrier social. Entre les retrouvailles familiales, les galettes de bureau, celles entre amis ou voisins, il est matériellement impossible de tout condenser en vingt-quatre heures. À cela s’ajoute une évolution plus profonde : la galette est devenue un produit saisonnier à part entière, au même titre que la bûche en décembre . Pour les artisans comme pour les grandes enseignes, janvier est un mois historiquement creux ; la galette vient le dynamiser, installer un rendez-vous réconfortant après les excès des fêtes. Résultat : on étire le plaisir, parfois jusqu’à la fin du mois — voire au-delà, pour les plus gourmands. Il y a aussi un facteur culturel non négligeable : la galette est un rituel ludique et fédérateur. La fève, la couronne, la règle de l’enfant sous la table… Tout concourt à en faire un moment de partage plus qu’un simple dessert. Or, un rituel, ça se répète. En vidéo, on a testé pour vous plusieurs galettes des rois : Frangipane classique, pomme, poire, noisette, pistache, praliné… Chaque année, les artisans rivalisent d’imagination pour surprendre une clientèle de plus en plus curieuse. La galette est devenue un laboratoire de tendances, où se croisent savoir-faire traditionnel et envies contemporaines. C’est dans ce contexte qu’apparaît — et s’impose — la fameuse galette au chocolat Dubaï. Sous ce nom évocateur, on ne trouve pas une recette officielle, mais un imaginaire très précis. Chocolat intense (souvent noir ou grand cru), garnitures opulentes, parfois relevées de pistache, de praliné très riche ou de touches orientales (sésame, fleur d’oranger). Certaines versions poussent le symbole jusqu’à l’or alimentaire ou à des finitions ultra-brillantes. Pourquoi “ Dubaï ” ? L’appellation « Dubaï » ne doit rien au hasard. Elle fait directement référence à la fameuse tablette de chocolat Dubaï, devenue virale sur les réseaux sociaux : une tablette ultra-gourmande, souvent fourrée, généreusement garnie et pensée comme un objet de désir autant que comme une sucrerie. Mais aussi parce que la ville incarne aujourd’hui une vision décomplexée du luxe alimentaire, très visible sur les réseaux sociaux : desserts spectaculaires, portions généreuses, ingrédients premium. La galette s’inscrit dans cette esthétique : elle n’est plus seulement bonne, elle doit être désirable, photogénique, presque ostentatoire. À lire aussi Ces boulangeries belges ont glissé des lingots d’or dans leur galette des rois D’un côté, on s’accroche aux rituels rassurants. De l’autre, on cherche l’exception, le twist, la nouveauté qui fait parler. La galette au chocolat Dubaï semble répondre à toutes les attentes contemporaines. Reste à savoir où s’en procurer : il faudra chercher. Car si elle a envahi TikTok et les réseaux sociaux, la galette au chocolat Dubaï est loin de faire l’unanimité chez les artisans. Pour l’heure, dans nos boulangeries belges, la galette des rois se décline encore majoritairement en versions somme toute classiques...",

Concernant Romelu Lukaku, les nouvelles sont bonnes. Dans des propos rapportés par Tuttosport, le médecin déclare à propos de Romelu Lukaku : « Si un joueur est sur le banc, il peut entrer sur le terrain. Ces deux ou trois derniers jours, Romelu a travaillé à fond avec l’équipe, il est complètement rétabli. Ensuite, c’est l’entraîneur qui décidera quand il sera prêt à jouer après une longue pause. » Naples se déplace à Copenhague, ce mardi soir, en Ligue des champions. Big Rom figure sur la liste européenne du Napli et pourrait donc être (techniquement) convoqué. À lire aussi Romelu Lukaku : « Après le Mondial, je veux jouer un autre grand tournoi mais en tant que joueur d’Anderlecht » Le médecin du club a également parlé du cas de Kevin De Bruyne, blessé lors du choc face à l’Inter Milan. « Le pronostic prévoit un retour complet à l’entraînement avec l’équipe entre fin février et début mars », précise-t-il. Romelu Lukaku était de retour dans le groupe de Naples en décembre dernier, lors de la Supercoupe d’Italie gagnée par son club. Mais Big Rom avait ensuite manqué les matchs suivants.",
